description: Cut a touch-code stable release. Bump MARKETING_VERSION in Project.xcconfig, promote CHANGELOG [Unreleased] to a dated version section, commit, tag vX.Y.Z, and push to trigger the GitHub Actions Developer-ID release pipeline. Use when shipping a new stable build.

# release: Cut a touch-code stable release

## Overview

A stable touch-code release is **a tag push**. The
`.github/workflows/release.yml` pipeline keys off `v*` tags: it builds,
signs (Developer ID), notarizes, generates a Sparkle-signed
`appcast.xml`, and drafts a GitHub Release with the DMG attached. CI
**fails loud** when the tag does not match `MARKETING_VERSION` in
`apps/mac/Configurations/Project.xcconfig`, so the release contract is:

> tag `vX.Y.Z` ⇔ `MARKETING_VERSION = X.Y.Z` ⇔ `CHANGELOG.md` has a
> `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section.

This skill walks those three artifacts into alignment, commits, tags,
pushes, and verifies CI started.

## When to use

- Ready to ship a new developer build to GitHub Releases / Sparkle clients.
- `[Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` has user-visible entries that warrant a release.

**Don't use** for:
- Hot-fixing CI or the release pipeline itself (no version bump).
- Local-only experiments — never tag without intent to publish.

## Project facts (load before acting)

| Concern | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| Marketing version (semver) | `apps/mac/Configurations/Project.xcconfig` → `MARKETING_VERSION` |
| Build number | same file → `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` (`YYYYMMDDNNN`, shared by stable and tip; `bump-version.sh` queries the published appcast and increments) |
| Bump tool | `apps/mac/scripts/bump-version.sh` (called by `make mac-bump-version`) |
| User-visible changelog | `CHANGELOG.md` (project root) — stable only; tip cuts do not touch CHANGELOG |
| Release CI | `.github/workflows/release.yml` (tag-triggered on `v*`) |
| Tag format | `vX.Y.Z` annotated |
| Distribution unit | DMG (notarized + stapled). Sparkle clients update from the same DMG. |
| Canonical Sparkle feed | `https://github.com/wanggang316/touch-code/releases/latest/download/appcast.xml` — always served from the most recent non-prerelease release |
| Past bump style | `chore(release): bump to X.Y.Z` (xcconfig only) |

`MARKETING_VERSION` is **not** strict SemVer pre-1.0 — every release is a
developer build (per `CHANGELOG.md` preamble). Default cadence is patch;
bump minor when behavior is materially different.

## Process

### 0. Pre-flight — refuse to proceed if any check fails

Run all checks in parallel via `Bash`:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD          # must be 'main' (or confirm with user)
git status --porcelain                    # must be empty
git fetch origin --tags                   # quiet; just refresh
git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main   # must be 0 0 (or 0 N if local-ahead is intentional)
git tag --sort=-creatordate | head -3     # show most recent tags
./apps/mac/scripts/bump-version.sh --print  # current MARKETING_VERSION + CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION + suggested next patch
```

Bail with a clear message if any of these are wrong:
- Not on `main` and user hasn't approved an off-`main` release.
- Working tree dirty.
- Local diverged from `origin/main` in a way the user didn't intend.
- A tag for the proposed version already exists.

### 1. Decide the version — ask the user

1. Read current `MARKETING_VERSION` and the `## [Unreleased]` section of
   `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Propose: **patch** by default (`0.1.3 → 0.1.4`).
3. Show the user a summary table:

   ```
   Current: 0.1.3 (build 20260510001)
   Next:    0.1.4 (build 20260511001)  <-- patch (default; build = next from appcast)
   Or:      0.2.0 (build 20260511001)  <-- minor (user-visible scope changed)

   Unreleased highlights:
     Added — Add Project picker can create new folders inline
     Added — Folder → git auto-promotion
     Changed — Worktree executing indicator on icon
     Fixed — ⌘⌫ guard for main worktree + sidebar focus
     Removed — Inline loading spinner
   ```

4. Wait for explicit confirmation of `X.Y.Z` and the new build number
   before proceeding. **Never invent a version silently.**

### 2. Verify the changelog has shippable content

If `[Unreleased]` is empty (or only contains category headers with no
entries), **stop**. Tell the user to run `/hs-changelog` first to
extract recent commits, then resume.

**Writing style — user-facing language.** Every changelog entry must
be understandable by a non-developer who uses the app. Rewrite the
raw commit messages into this style before cutting the version
section. Rules:

- **Describe what changed, not how.** "Terminal output no longer gets
  cut off" instead of "Clear O_NONBLOCK on accepted client fds."
- **Name the feature, not the implementation.** "Choose between stable
  and pre-release update channels" instead of "Sparkle channel picker."
- **Use the UI surface the user sees.** "Settings → Updates" not
  "UpdatesSettingsView"; "sidebar" not "ProjectListView."
- **Drop internal identifiers.** No module names, no config keys, no
  protocol specifics (`EPIPE`, `SO_NOSIGPIPE`, `O_NONBLOCK`). If the
  fix matters to users, describe the symptom it resolves.
- **One sentence per entry.** Bold the user-facing summary, then a
  brief explanation of what it does. No more than two lines.
- **Omit changes invisible to users.** Refactors, CI changes, build
  script tweaks, dependency bumps — unless they fix a user-visible bug.

### 3. Cut the changelog version section

Edit `CHANGELOG.md`:

1. Replace `## [Unreleased]` with two sections:
   - A fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` at top with all six standard
     headers (`Added / Changed / Deprecated / Removed / Fixed /
     Security`) but **leave them empty** — the next cycle fills them.
   - The previous `[Unreleased]` body promoted under
     `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` (today's date in the user's local TZ).
2. Show the diff to the user before writing.

### 4. Bump the version files

```bash
make mac-bump-version VERSION=X.Y.Z
# or, with an explicit build number override (rarely needed):
make mac-bump-version VERSION=X.Y.Z BUILD=N
```

The Makefile target wraps `apps/mac/scripts/bump-version.sh`, which:
- validates `X.Y.Z` semver format,
- refuses if the new marketing version isn't strictly greater than the current,
- queries the published appcast for the highest build number (both
  stable and tip), then increments by 1 (or starts at `YYYYMMDD001`
  for a new calendar day),
- writes via tmpfile + post-write verification (atomic),
- and the Makefile guard refuses to run if `apps/mac/Configurations`
  has uncommitted changes.

Do **not** hand-edit `Project.xcconfig` — the script is the rule.

CI rejects a tag whose version doesn't match `MARKETING_VERSION` —
this is the gate that prevents accidental tag pushes.

### 5. Optional build verification

Default: **skip** the build (CI will catch real problems and the
pipeline takes ~10–20 minutes locally). Run `make mac-check` (fast,
~10s) only if the user has unrelated lint debt and wants to be sure
the bump commit is clean.

Run a full local `make mac-build` only if explicitly requested.

### 6. Commit — only the two bumped files

Show the user the staged diff before committing.

```bash
git add CHANGELOG.md apps/mac/Configurations/Project.xcconfig
git status                  # confirm only those two files are staged
git diff --cached            # final eyeball
```

Commit message format (matches `c65abde`, `9e6e5a0`, `2748a1f`):

```
chore(release): bump to X.Y.Z
```

No body unless the release has unusual notes (e.g., schema break worth
flagging in `git log` independently of the changelog). **No
Co-Authored-By trailer** — see `~/.claude/.../memory/feedback_no_coauthor_in_commits.md`.

Use a HEREDOC for the message:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore(release): bump to X.Y.Z
EOF
)"
```

### 7. Tag — annotated, with release highlights

```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
vX.Y.Z

<one short paragraph summarizing the release in user-facing language;
pull from CHANGELOG — describe what's new/improved/fixed, not how>
EOF
)"
```

The annotated message ends up on the GitHub Release page. Use the
same user-facing language as the CHANGELOG — no implementation
details, no module names.

**Do not push yet.** Confirm with the user that the tag looks right
(`git show vX.Y.Z --stat`).

### 8. Push — commit first, tag second

```bash
git push origin main
git push origin vX.Y.Z       # triggers .github/workflows/release.yml
```

Push order matters: pushing the tag first races CI against a
not-yet-visible commit. The CI checks out by ref name (`tag ==
commit`), so the commit must be on the remote before the tag.

If the user wants to pre-flight without triggering CI, use
`workflow_dispatch` with an existing tag instead of pushing a new one
— but that's an escape hatch, not the default.

### 9. Verify CI started

```bash
gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit 1
gh run watch                          # follow the active run, optional
# When green:
gh release view vX.Y.Z                # the draft release
```

Tell the user:
- CI status (queued / running / passed / failed).
- The release is **draft** — the release body is the CHANGELOG section
  for this version (CI extracts it automatically). The user still needs
  to publish it manually via the GitHub UI or
  `gh release edit vX.Y.Z --draft=false`.

If CI fails, **do not** delete the tag or force-push without explicit
user approval — diagnose first (`gh run view --log-failed`).

## Failure modes & recovery

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| CI step "Verify tag matches MARKETING_VERSION" red | xcconfig wasn't bumped, or tag was created before bump landed | Bump xcconfig in a new commit, delete & recreate tag (`git tag -d vX.Y.Z; git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z`) — confirm with user before deleting remote tag |
| Tag pushed without CHANGELOG section | Skipped step 3 | Add the section in a follow-up `docs(changelog): record vX.Y.Z` commit on `main`; do not retag |
| Notarization fails | Apple-side; secrets correct but build flagged | Check `gh run view --log-failed`, often transient — re-run via `workflow_dispatch` against the existing tag |
| Wrong version pushed | Bumped to e.g. 0.2.0 when user wanted 0.1.4 | Roll forward only — pull next version, supersede with a new tag. Do not rewrite history on `main`. |

## Verification checklist

Before reporting "done":

- [ ] `git tag --sort=-creatordate | head -1` shows the new tag.
- [ ] `git log -1 --oneline origin/main` shows `chore(release): bump to X.Y.Z`.
- [ ] `awk -F'=' '/^MARKETING_VERSION/ ...' apps/mac/Configurations/Project.xcconfig` matches the tag.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` with non-empty body and a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` above.
- [ ] `gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit 1` shows a queued or running job.
- [ ] User informed the GitHub Release will land as **draft** and needs manual publish.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Bumping `MARKETING_VERSION` and `CHANGELOG.md` in separate commits — pre-1.0 we keep the bump atomic.
- ❌ `git add -A` / `git add -u` — only stage the release files.
- ❌ Co-Authored-By trailer on the bump commit.
- ❌ Lightweight tag (`git tag vX.Y.Z`) — always annotated.
- ❌ Pushing tag before commit.
- ❌ Auto-publishing the GitHub Release — leave it draft for human review.
- ❌ Force-pushing `main` to "fix" a bad bump — roll forward instead.
- ❌ Hand-editing `appcast.xml` — the CI pipelines are the only writer.
