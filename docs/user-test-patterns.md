# User-Test Patterns — touch-code

**Status:** Initial draft, written alongside [user-tests/notifications-v1-1.md](user-tests/notifications-v1-1.md). Expand as more features adopt the user-test pattern.

This document defines the project-wide conventions a user-test case must follow so the same case can be executed by a human dogfooder, an automated UI probe, or a runtime validator subagent without further translation.

## Surfaces and Tooling

touch-code is a native macOS app shipping three user-facing surfaces:

| Surface | Probe approach | Allowed selectors |
|---|---|---|
| **SwiftUI window UI** (main window, Settings window, sheets, alerts, context menus) | Manual visual probe by a human dogfooder; `XCUITest` for automated probes (preferred when the build target supports it) | Accessibility identifiers (`accessibilityIdentifier(_:)`), visible role + label (e.g., `Toggle("Sound", isOn:)` → role=switch, name="Sound"), or unambiguous on-screen text |
| **`tc` CLI** (JSON-RPC client → app) | Shell invocations with `tc …` and stdout/exit-code assertions | Subcommand name + flags; `--json` output where supported |
| **Persisted state files** (`~/.config/touch-code/{settings,catalog,notifications,detection-rules}.json`, plus log lines) | `jq` queries against file content; `log stream` / `Console.app` filters against `subsystem:"com.touch-code.*"` | File path + JSON key path; log filter expression |

If a case cannot be expressed in one of these probe languages, the case is mis-scoped — either the assertion is implementation-internal (move to a unit test) or the surface needs a new accessibility identifier (raise it as a precondition / spec-amendment, do not work around with brittle selectors).

## Forbidden Selectors

- CSS classes, DOM positions, internal `data-test-*` ids invented inside a single case (any data-test id used in a case must be declared by the source code with a stable, documented name).
- Screen coordinates (`click at (314, 220)`) unless the case explicitly calls out window-chrome behaviour the macOS Accessibility tree cannot represent.
- Internal symbol names — never name a Swift type, function, file path, or module in a case. Black-box only.
- Sleep timers as a proxy for state ("wait 3 seconds then assert") — wait on an observable signal (badge label change, file mtime, log line).

## Ready Signals

Every case that drives the app must wait on a ready signal before executing steps:

| Surface | Ready signal |
|---|---|
| App launched | Dock icon visible AND main window's worktree status bar contains the bell button |
| Settings window open | `Settings → Notifications` section header is visible AND the macOS-permission status row has resolved to one of `Authorized` / `Denied` / `Not yet asked` |
| Pane attached | Pane chrome shows the prompt cursor OR the spinner "Spinning up shell…" has disappeared |
| Notification emitted | Either: a Dock badge label change, a log line under `subsystem:"com.touch-code.notifications"` `category:"coordinator"` with a recognised verb (`posted`, `drop`), or a row in `~/.config/touch-code/notifications.json`'s `entries` array (whichever the case names) |

## Fixture Seeding

Files are placed under the user's `~/.config/touch-code/` before app launch. Each case names the exact files it seeds; the runner is responsible for backing up and restoring the user's real files around the case.

```
~/.config/touch-code/
  settings.json            — owned by SettingsStore; seed-able before launch
  catalog.json             — owned by CatalogStore; seed-able before launch
  notifications.json       — owned by NotificationStore; seed-able before launch
  detection-rules.json     — owned by the (forthcoming) mute-rules surface
```

Fixtures shared across cases live under `docs/user-tests/_shared/fixtures/`. Case-local fixtures live under `docs/user-tests/<feature>/fixtures/`.

## Time and Clock

Cases do not assume real wall-clock time. Where a case needs "now" semantics (e.g., the 1-second keystroke window, the 30-second idle threshold), the case specifies the wait via an observable signal or an injected fake clock — never `sleep 30`.

For cases that genuinely require duration progression (a command running for ≥10 seconds to cross a threshold), the case names the lower-bound wait and ties the assertion to an observable event (Dock badge appears) rather than the wall-clock value.

## Artifacts on FAIL

Every case lists what to capture on FAIL. Defaults that apply to every case unless overridden:

- `screenshot.png` — full-window screenshot at first failed assertion.
- `console.log` — `log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.touch-code.notifications"' --last 5m` output around the failure.
- For probes that touched a state file: a copy of the file at failure time, named `<file>.snapshot.json`.

## Personas

Personas are reusable across features. The shared registry is `docs/user-tests/_shared/personas.yaml`. A persona is a stable identity (name + role + typical configuration) the case can refer to without re-specifying. New personas added during authoring are recorded in the case's "Personas / Fixtures Added" section.

## Out of Scope (deferred)

- Visual regression / snapshot diffing of arbitrary view layouts. Cases assert observable state, not pixel fidelity.
- Performance budgets. Cases that need a perf SLO (latency under N ms, FPS above N) cite the existing perf-budget gate instead and explicitly mark the AC as "not user-observable".
- Cross-version migration tests beyond what a fixture seed expresses. Migration coverage lives in the relevant module's unit suite.
