# ExecPlan: Command Palette (Quick Action)

**Status:** In Progress
**Author:** Gump
**Date:** 2026-04-23

This is a living document. The Progress, Surprises & Discoveries, Decision Log, and Outcomes & Retrospective sections must be kept up to date as work proceeds.

## Purpose

After this change, a touch-code user can:

- Press **⌘P** from anywhere in the main window and see a floating search box at the top-center of the active window.
- Type a few characters and see a fuzzy-ranked list of every command currently available — Space switching, Worktree switching, "Open in default editor", "Toggle Git Viewer", split/new-tab/focus pane actions, new/close window, open settings — without needing to remember which menu hosts each.
- Press **↑/↓** to move selection, **Enter** to execute, **Esc** (or click outside) to dismiss.
- On reopen, see their recently-used commands float to the top: commands activated within the last 30 days are boosted, with half-life = 7 days.
- Press the ghostty keybind bound to `toggle_command_palette` (if the user configured one in `ghostty/config`) and see the same palette open — the existing intent hook in `PaneActionRouterFeature.Delegate.commandPaletteToggleRequested` stops being a no-op.

Nothing new happens at the "what can the app do" layer — every command invoked from the palette already has a dedicated entry point (menu, sidebar row, header button, ghostty keybind). The palette is a single keyboard-first surface that lowers the discovery cost for all of them.

## Progress

- [x] M0 — Baseline: `xcodebuild build` green (2026-04-23); 8 pre-existing lint violations recorded below and out of scope
- [x] M1 — Data types: `CommandPaletteItem` + `Kind` enum + `KeyEquivalentDescriptor` landed in `App/Features/CommandPalette/` (2026-04-23, commit ab7e34f); build green
- [x] M2 — Vertical slice: feature + view + wiring landed in two commits 8150d41 + 77d4e07 (2026-04-23); build green. Note: the ghostty `toggle_command_palette` hook at `RootFeature:421` also replaced in the same pass (originally planned for M5) — the branch is one line and tying it to M2 avoids shipping a live palette that doesn't respond to the already-decoded ghostty intent.
- [x] M3 — Full fuzzy scorer with DP subsequence + recency decay + 12 unit tests (2026-04-23, commit b2cc021); all tests green
- [x] M4 — Recency persistence + pruner + LRU cap + 9 tests (2026-04-23, commit 12856d8); all tests green. Note: switched from `@Shared(.appStorage)` to parent-owned `UserDefaults` round-trip (see D15).
- [x] M5 — Full command set: items builder expanded to all Kind cases (2026-04-23, commits e4826e7 + e20dffe); RootFeature.route fan-out exhaustive; ghostty hook rewired in M2. 12 new tests (items + routing contract).
- [x] M6 — 33 palette tests green across 5 suites (Feature/Pruner/Scorer/Items/Routing); RootFeature existing 16-test suite green; lint back to baseline (8 pre-existing, 0 palette-introduced) after commit 67ca462. Manual QA + PR pending human sign-off post codex review.

## Surprises & Discoveries

- **S1** (2026-04-23, M0): `make -C apps/mac lint` emitted 8 **pre-existing** violations on `feature/command-p` before any palette edit: `EditorService+Test.swift:128,144` (async-without-await), `EditorService+Live.swift:36` (todo), `PaneActionRouterFeature.swift:64` (superfluous disable), `PaneSurface.swift:195` (cyclomatic), `GhosttyActionDecoder.swift:142` (cyclomatic + function-body-length), `PanelSurfaceApplyTests.swift:27` (cyclomatic). Out of palette scope; tracked here so the post-work lint comparison is apples-to-apples. No palette-introduced violations shall join that list.
- **S2** (2026-04-23, M0): `git-wt` submodule was not checked out on this worktree — `xcodebuild` failed at the "Verify git-wt" pre-script until `git submodule update --init apps/mac/ThirdParty/git-wt` completed. No code change needed; add to the onboarding note if other agents bootstrap this branch.

## Decision Log

- **D1** (planning, 2026-04-23): Palette lives as a child of `RootFeature`, presented via `@Presents var commandPalette: CommandPaletteFeature.State?`. Matches the `@Presents var spaceManagerSheet` pattern at `RootFeature.swift:46`. Discarding query/selection on close is deliberate — a palette that remembers your last query confuses more than it helps.
- **D2** (planning, 2026-04-23): Palette view is a **ZStack overlay**, not `.sheet(item:)`. The ContentView already hosts a ZStack where the Git Viewer overlay lives; palette joins there at `.zIndex(100)`. `.sheet` was rejected because it dims the window chrome, animates slowly, and pre-empts `Esc` before the reducer can handle activation-and-dismiss.
- **D3** (planning, 2026-04-23): Command items are **rebuilt on open**, not held as a static catalog. `CommandPaletteItems.build(for:)` is a pure function over `(Catalog, HierarchySelection, EditorFeature.State)`. This makes context-sensitivity free — if no Worktree is selected, worktree-scoped Kinds simply aren't in the list — and avoids a registration protocol that would only pay off with a plugin system we do not have.
- **D4** (planning, 2026-04-23): Activation routes through a new `CommandPaletteFeature.Action.Delegate.activate(Kind)` that `RootFeature` pattern-matches into existing feature actions (`.editor(.openRequested)`, `.gitViewerToggledForCurrentWorktree`, `.switchToSpaceAtIndex`, `.sidebar(.spaceRowTapped)`, `.panelActionRouter(.requested)`, `.windowActionRouter(.requested)`, `SettingsWindowPresenter.open()`). No new client, no new dependency; every branch reuses a path that already ships.
- **D5** (planning, 2026-04-23): **Pane-scoped palette actions resolve the target pane on demand, not from `HierarchySelection`.** Confirmed while reading `HierarchyClient.swift:268` — `HierarchySelection` carries `(spaceID, projectID, worktreeID)` only; no `paneID` field. The `route(_:)` helper walks `Tab.selectedPanelID` in the current catalog snapshot to find the focused pane when dispatching a `Kind.panelAction(…)`. No `HierarchySelection` schema change.
- **D6** (planning, 2026-04-23): Ghostty-sourced `toggle_command_palette` intent is reused. `PaneActionRouterFeature.swift:42` already emits `Delegate.commandPaletteToggleRequested`; `RootFeature.swift:421` currently consumes it as an explicit no-op. In M5 that branch becomes `.send(.commandPalette(.togglePresented))`.
- **D7** (planning, 2026-04-23): Recency stored as `[String: TimeInterval]` under UserDefaults key `commandPaletteRecency` via `@Shared(.appStorage(...))`. Rejected routing it through `SettingsStore` — settings are atomic-rename JSON on disk with a 500 ms debounce designed for versioned user-facing preferences, not for write-heavy ephemeral counters touched on every palette activation.
- **D8** (planning, 2026-04-23): First cut ships **no category/section headers** in the UI and **no mode prefixes** (`>`, `@`, `:`). Flat list ordered by score. These can be added later without breaking existing recency IDs.
- **D9** (planning, 2026-04-23): `⌘K` Space switcher stays as-is. Palette can select any Space by typing its name, but `⌘K` is muscle memory and removing it is a separate UX call that should not block palette landing.
- **D10** (M2, 2026-04-23): Palette entry action is `RootFeature.Action.commandPaletteToggle` (a top-level case), not a `.commandPalette(.present)` case. The toggle reducer branch creates `CommandPaletteFeature.State()` and immediately dispatches `.commandPalette(.presented(.appeared(selection, catalog)))` so the items are built from live state on the reducer tick rather than the view's `.task`. Keeps the build-items phase inside TCA's test-observable tick instead of a SwiftUI lifecycle side effect.
- **D11** (M2, 2026-04-23): Ghostty `toggle_command_palette` hook wired in M2 instead of M5. The original plan deferred it one milestone; the branch is a one-line `.send(.commandPaletteToggle)` and shipping the live palette without the hook would ship a visible inconsistency (the ghostty keybind is decoded but the palette is inert). Tying them keeps the user-visible surface honest at every commit.
- **D12** (M2, 2026-04-23): View dismisses via an `onDismiss` closure injected by the parent, not a `.dismissed` reducer action. The feature has no teardown work of its own; `RootFeature.commandPaletteToggle` is the single dismiss path. Avoids a second, redundant action that the test store would also have to observe.
- **D13** (M3, 2026-04-23): Subsequence scorer is **DP over (needle, haystack) positions**, not greedy left-to-right matching. Greedy fails on realistic inputs like `"nt"` on `"Open New Tab"` — the left-most 'n' lives inside "Open" and carries no separator bonus, so greedy scores lower than random titles with early 'n's. DP is `O(m·n)` where `m ≤ 40` (query cap) and `n ≤ 120` (title cap); at real-world sizes the total scoring work for a 200-item catalog stays inside the 16 ms budget by a wide margin.
- **D14** (M3, 2026-04-23): Separator bonus = 20, camelCase bonus = 10, first-char bonus = 10, gap penalty = 1 per skipped char, span penalty = 2 per covered char. These constants were tuned against the test suite; they strike a balance where a word-start two-char subsequence match (e.g. 'nt' on 'Open New Tab') beats a same-length earlier subsequence match without word boundaries, while still letting recency reorder within a band without flipping across bands.
- **D15** (M4, 2026-04-23): Recency persistence routed through a plain `UserDefaults` helper (`CommandPaletteRecencyPersistence`), not `@Shared(.appStorage(…))`. The Sharing library's `.appStorage` key-path API has limited Dictionary support and would have required an extra encoding hop via `Codable` or a custom `SharedKey` conformance; a single read on toggle + single write on activate keeps the semantics simpler and testable via `withSuite(_:)`. Tradeoff acknowledged: SwiftUI views cannot observe the recency map directly, which is fine because the UI never needs to.
- **D16** (M4, 2026-04-23): Recency is written to `state.recency` on activation and then pulled up by `RootFeature` before nil-ing the `@Presents` slot. This keeps the child reducer pure (no `UserDefaults` dependency in tests) at the cost of a small coupling — RootFeature has to remember to persist after `activate`. A `@Dependency` client would have inverted this; chose not to add one for a single call site.

## Outcomes & Retrospective

**Result (2026-04-23):** Command Palette shipped across 7 commits on
`feature/command-p`. The feature opens via `⌘P` or the ghostty
`toggle_command_palette` keybind, searches every user-visible
command — App / Spaces / Worktree / Editor / Pane / Window — via a
three-band fuzzy scorer with recency decay, and dispatches every
activation through existing feature actions with no new client, no new
ghostty decoder case, and no new `HierarchySelection` field.

**Lines of code (net additions, excluding docs):**

- Feature: ~720 lines across `CommandPalette/` (6 files)
- RootFeature edits: +120 lines
- ContentView / MainWindowCommands edits: +14 lines
- Tests: ~690 lines across 5 suites (33 tests)

**Test coverage:** 33 palette-specific tests + existing 16-test
`RootFeatureTests` stayed green. Scorer DP branch is covered by 12
table-driven cases; pruner retention + LRU by 3; feature reducer by 6;
items builder by 5; routing contract by 7.

**Post-M6 follow-up (Codex review):** A second-opinion review of the
shipped feature flagged two critical issues and three concerns. All
five were addressed in commits 21e1f1d + 5dbd416:

- **C1 — Pane commands targeted leftmost split, not focused split.**
  Plumbed `PaneID` through `PaneActionRouterFeature.Delegate.command-
  PaletteToggleRequested(PaneID)` → `RootFeature.commandPaletteToggle
  (PaneID?)` → `CommandPaletteFeature.Action.appeared(...,
  focusedPanelID, panelFocusPrecise)`. Focus-dependent Pane items
  (newSplit, gotoSplit, toggleSplitZoom) are only emitted when the
  ghostty path supplied the pane; menu-triggered opens still get
  tab-scoped Pane items and all Window items (any leaf in the tab
  resolves to the same NSWindow).
- **C2 — `Kind.selectWorktree` routed but never generated.** Items
  builder now emits one "Switch to Worktree: &lt;name&gt;" per worktree
  in the active Space (except the currently selected one).
- **Concern 3 — DP scorer applied span penalty outside endpoint
  selection.** Span and position terms are now computed inside the
  final-row scan so the returned score is the true maximum.
- **Concern 4 — Pruned recency lost on plain dismiss.** RootFeature
  now persists the child's pruned recency on dismiss *and* on
  activation.
- **Concern 5 — CamelCase bonus unreachable.** Subsequence scorer now
  carries both a case-folded haystack (for matching) and an
  original-case haystack (for `charBonus` detection), so
  `prev.isLowercase && char.isUppercase` actually fires.

**Deviations from plan:**

- D10: Palette entry action is `commandPaletteToggle` (top-level),
  not `.commandPalette(.presented(.togglePresented))` — the reducer
  creates state and fires `.appeared(...)` immediately so items are
  built on the reducer tick rather than a SwiftUI lifecycle side
  effect.
- D11: Ghostty intent hook (`PaneActionRouter.Delegate.command-
  PaletteToggleRequested`) wired in M2 instead of M5 to avoid
  shipping an inert ghostty keybind through a released milestone.
- D13: Subsequence scorer is DP over (needle, haystack) positions,
  not greedy — needed to make `"nt"` prefer `"Open [N]ew [T]ab"` over
  a left-anchored no-separator match.
- D15: Recency persistence uses a plain `UserDefaults` helper, not
  `@Shared(.appStorage(...))`. The Sharing library's AppStorage
  dictionary support is thin; a single-read-on-open /
  single-write-on-activate round-trip is simpler.

**Lessons:**

- The Ghostty side of the app was already expecting a command-palette
  feature (`PaneActionRequest.toggleCommandPalette`,
  `PaneActionRouterFeature.Delegate.commandPaletteToggleRequested`,
  the explicit-no-op at `RootFeature:421`). Wiring into pre-existing
  hooks was cheaper than inventing new plumbing.
- Greedy subsequence matching gives intuitive-looking results on
  easy inputs and surprising results on the common "first letter of
  each word" pattern. DP is the right default.
- Procedural item generation vs a registry protocol was the right
  call: 26 items across 6 context bands took ~200 lines of straight-
  line Swift, no new cross-target API surface. A protocol would have
  earned its keep only with plugin-sourced commands we don't have.

## Context and Orientation

Related documents:

- Design doc: `docs/design-docs/command-palette.md` — read in full before M1. Contains the state/action shapes, the scorer rules, the seven alternatives considered, and the risk table. This ExecPlan does not duplicate them.
- Architecture: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/golden-rules.md`.
- Ghostty routing precedent: `docs/design-docs/0008-ghostty-action-routing.md`. The palette reuses `PaneActionRequest` / `WindowActionRequest` verbatim, so understanding the decoder → router → root fan-out is load-bearing.

Key source files to read (in this order) before M1:

- `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/Root/RootFeature.swift` — the parent reducer. Lines 17–42 hold the `State` struct the palette extends; line 46 is the `@Presents var spaceManagerSheet` pattern the palette mirrors; lines 135–137 (`spaceManagerSheetShown`, `spaceManagerSheet(PresentationAction<…>)`, `switchToSpaceAtIndex`) are the Action shape precedent; line 421 is the `panelActionRouter(.delegate)` no-op branch that M5 replaces; the `.ifLet(\.$spaceManagerSheet, …)` at line 486 is where `.ifLet(\.$commandPalette, …)` lands.
- `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/SpaceManager/SpaceManagerFeature.swift` — **read for shape only, do not edit**. This is the cleanest in-tree example of a `@Presents`-hosted child reducer. The new feature's file layout (`State` / `Action` / `body: some Reducer` / `Delegate`) matches this one.
- `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Commands/MainWindowCommands.swift` — the `CommandGroup(after: .newItem)` block. A new `Button("Quick Action…") { store.send(.commandPalette(.togglePresented)) }.keyboardShortcut("p", modifiers: .command)` is inserted *above* the existing ⌘E / ⌘⇧G / ⌘K block.
- `apps/mac/touch-code/App/ContentView.swift` — the overlay host. The palette overlay is mounted in the same `ZStack` that already carries the Git Viewer overlay, with `.zIndex(100)` so it sits above it.
- `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/PaneActionRouter/PaneActionRouterFeature.swift` — lines 37–43 declare `Delegate.commandPaletteToggleRequested`; lines 179–180 emit it. Nothing changes here; M5 just connects the delegate to a real action in `RootFeature`.
- `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/PaneActionRequest.swift` and `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/WindowActionRequest.swift` — the public enums `CommandPaletteItem.Kind` wraps. **Do not edit these enums**. Every case is reachable from the palette by adding a `Kind.panelAction(case)` or `Kind.windowAction(case)` item to `build(for:)`.
- `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Clients/HierarchyClient.swift` — lines 268–274 (`HierarchySelection`) confirm the selection does not carry a pane ID; palette routing resolves the focused pane by walking `Tab.selectedPanelID` from the catalog snapshot. No client changes.
- `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/Editor/EditorFeature.swift` — look up `State.descriptors` and `State.globalDefault`; the palette item builder reads both to emit `Kind.openCurrentWorktreeIn(EditorID)` items for each installed editor.

Terms of art:

- **Kind** — a discriminated enum inside `CommandPaletteItem` describing what the item does. One case per command family; parameterized cases carry stable IDs (e.g. `SpaceID`) so recency survives app restart.
- **Recency** — a `[stableCommandID: lastActivationTimestamp]` map persisted to UserDefaults. Read during scoring to apply an exponential-decay bonus; written on every command activation.
- **Contiguous mode** — the fuzzy scorer matches the query as a single substring of the title, not as a subsequence. Triggered by a double-quoted query (`"git view"`) or implicitly as the highest-scoring match when both succeed.
- **Focused pane resolution** — given a `HierarchySelection`, the palette finds the pane to target by looking up the selected Worktree's `selectedTabID`, then that Tab's `selectedPanelID`. The `RootFeature.resolveActiveTab` helper at line 509 is the existing precedent; a sibling helper `resolveFocusedPanelID` is added for palette routing.

Test target layout:

- `apps/mac/touch-code/Tests/` — home for `CommandPaletteFeatureTests` (new), `CommandPaletteItemsTests` (new), `RootFeatureCommandPaletteRoutingTests` (new).
- `apps/mac/TouchCodeCoreTests/` — home for `CommandPaletteFuzzyScorerTests` (new). Scorer has no TCA dependency, so it belongs in Core tests; follow the placement of existing pure-function tests (e.g. `CatalogCodableTests`).

## Plan of Work

The work is sliced vertically so every milestone produces an observably-working palette. M2 proves the full pipeline end-to-end with three commands; M3–M5 deepen the feature without rebuilding the substrate.

### Milestone 0 — Baseline

Before any edit, confirm the working tree builds clean on the current branch:

```
make -C apps/mac lint
xcodebuild build -scheme touch-code -destination 'platform=macOS'
```

Record any pre-existing lint or test failures so the post-work comparison is apples-to-apples. If unrelated failures exist, escalate before touching code — the palette should not silently inherit regressions.

### Milestone 1 — Data types (no behavior)

Create the feature directory `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/CommandPalette/` and drop in two files with types only:

- `CommandPaletteItem.swift` — `struct CommandPaletteItem: Equatable, Identifiable` with fields `id: String`, `title: String`, `subtitle: String?`, `icon: String`, `shortcut: KeyEquivalentDescriptor?`, `priorityTier: Int`, `hiddenWhenQueryEmpty: Bool`, `kind: Kind`. The `Kind` enum lists the 16 cases named in design doc §3.3.1. All enums conform to `Equatable`; nothing is public because the feature is internal to the macOS target.
- `KeyEquivalentDescriptor.swift` — a `struct { let keys: [String] }` used only for display (e.g. rendering `"⌘⇧G"` on a row). Not a real `SwiftUI.KeyEquivalent` — the view converts it to a `Text` label at render time.

No reducer, no view yet. Verify by `xcodebuild build -scheme touch-code`: the new files compile as dead code. No behavior change visible.

### Milestone 2 — Vertical slice with three commands

This is the smallest version of the palette that proves the entire pipeline works end-to-end. Three commands, a stub scorer, real view, real routing.

1. **`CommandPaletteItems.swift`** — pure function `static func build(forSelection: HierarchySelection, editor: EditorFeature.State, catalog: Catalog) -> [CommandPaletteItem]`. For M2 return exactly three items unconditionally: `openSettings`, `toggleGitViewer`, `checkForUpdates`. (Later milestones flesh it out.)

2. **`CommandPaletteFuzzyScorer.swift`** — stub: `static func score(item:query:recency:now:) -> Int?` returns `item.title.lowercased().contains(query.lowercased()) ? 1 : nil` for non-empty query, `1` for empty. Full scorer lands in M3.

3. **`CommandPaletteFeature.swift`** — `@Reducer` with `@ObservableState struct State: Equatable { var query: String = ""; var selectionID: CommandPaletteItem.ID?; var items: [CommandPaletteItem] = []; var filtered: [CommandPaletteItem] = [] }`. Actions: `togglePresented`, `dismissed`, `queryChanged(String)`, `selectionMoved(Direction)`, `selectionCommitted`, `rowTapped(ID)`, `catalogChanged`, `delegate(Delegate)` where `Delegate = .activate(Kind)`. The reducer:
   - On `togglePresented` / `catalogChanged`: invoke `CommandPaletteItems.build`, store in `state.items`, recompute `state.filtered`, set `state.selectionID` to the first filtered item's id.
   - On `queryChanged(s)`: set `state.query = s`, recompute `state.filtered`, reset selection to first.
   - On `selectionMoved(.up/.down)`: move `selectionID` within `state.filtered` with wrap.
   - On `selectionCommitted` / `rowTapped`: look up the selected item, emit `.delegate(.activate(item.kind))`. Reducer does not clear state itself — dismissal is driven by the parent clearing `@Presents` via `.ifLet`.

4. **`CommandPaletteView.swift`** — ZStack overlay per design doc §3.6. A dimmed scrim tap-gesture sends `.dismissed`. Keyboard handling uses `.onKeyPress(.escape/.upArrow/.downArrow/.return)`. The text field is auto-focused via `@FocusState`.

5. **`RootFeature.swift` edits:**
   - Add `@Presents var commandPalette: CommandPaletteFeature.State?` near `spaceManagerSheet` (line ~46).
   - Add action cases `commandPalette(PresentationAction<CommandPaletteFeature.Action>)` and local `commandPaletteToggle` — the latter converts the top-level toggle into the presentation set/clear.
   - Compose via `.ifLet(\.$commandPalette, action: \.commandPalette) { CommandPaletteFeature() }` right after the existing `.ifLet(\.$spaceManagerSheet, …)` at line 486.
   - Add a private helper `route(_ kind: CommandPaletteItem.Kind, state: inout State) -> Effect<Action>`. For M2, handle only three cases: `.openSettings` → `settingsWindowPresenter.open()` via `.run`; `.toggleGitViewer` → `.send(.gitViewerToggledForCurrentWorktree)`; `.checkForUpdates` → placeholder `.none` (wiring lands in M5).
   - Pattern-match `.commandPalette(.presented(.delegate(.activate(let kind))))` → `return route(kind, state: &state)` and also set `state.commandPalette = nil` so the overlay dismisses immediately on commit.

6. **`ContentView.swift` edits:** inside the existing `ZStack` (same one hosting the Git Viewer overlay), add the palette overlay:

   ```swift
   if let paletteStore = store.scope(state: \.commandPalette, action: \.commandPalette.presented) {
     CommandPaletteView(store: paletteStore)
       .zIndex(100)
       .transition(.opacity.combined(with: .scale(scale: 0.97)))
   }
   ```

7. **`MainWindowCommands.swift` edits:** add a new `Button("Quick Action…") { store.send(.commandPaletteToggle) }.keyboardShortcut("p", modifiers: .command)` as the first entry of the `CommandGroup(after: .newItem)` block.

Verify end-to-end: `make -C apps/mac mac-run-app`, press `⌘P`, type "set", press Enter. The Settings window must open. Reopen palette, type "git", press Enter. Git Viewer overlay must toggle.

### Milestone 3 — Full fuzzy scorer

Replace the M2 stub `CommandPaletteFuzzyScorer.score` with the real implementation per design doc §3.3.3. Score rules in priority order:

1. Empty query: items with `hiddenWhenQueryEmpty == true` return `nil`; others return a score derived from recency + priorityTier only (no match bonus).
2. Non-empty query: attempt contiguous substring match on `title` (case-folded). Match → base `0x2_0000` + length-ratio bonus. Else attempt subsequence match on `title` → base `0x1_0000`. Else subsequence match on `subtitle` → base `0x0_8000`. No match → `nil`.
3. Add per-character bonus: `+5` for a query char matching a title char that follows `/`; `+4` for `- _ . space`; `+2` for an uppercase letter at start-of-word.
4. Add recency bonus: `R * 0.5^(ageDays / 7)` capped at 30 days; `R` chosen so a recent-but-subsequence match loses to a never-used contiguous match.
5. Quoted-query rule: when `query` starts and ends with `"`, skip subsequence mode entirely — contiguous only.

Add `CommandPaletteFuzzyScorerTests` in `apps/mac/TouchCodeCoreTests/` with table-driven cases:

- Contiguous `"git"` on "Toggle Git Viewer" outranks subsequence `"gtv"` on the same.
- Prefix `"ope"` outranks suffix `"ngs"` on "Open Settings".
- Recency bonus reorders within a bucket but cannot flip a contiguous match below a subsequence match.
- Quoted query `"\"git view\""` drops subsequence-only matches.
- Deterministic on identical input (sort stable).

Verify: `xcodebuild test -scheme touch-code -only-testing:TouchCodeCoreTests/CommandPaletteFuzzyScorerTests` expects all cases passing.

### Milestone 4 — Recency

Add persistence:

1. In `CommandPaletteFeature.swift`, add `@Shared(.appStorage("commandPaletteRecency")) var recency: [String: TimeInterval] = [:]` at the feature level. Not on `State` — the `@Shared` property is injected at composition time.
2. On `.selectionCommitted` / `.rowTapped`: before emitting the delegate, write `recency[item.id] = Date().timeIntervalSince1970`. Apply a 200-entry LRU cap: when size exceeds 200, drop the oldest-timestamp entries until size = 200.
3. On `.togglePresented`: prune dead IDs. Rule: for every key in `recency` whose prefix matches `"space.select."`, `"worktree.select."`, or `"editor.open."`, drop the key if the parameter (UUID after the dot) is not present in the freshly-built items list. Static IDs are never pruned.
4. Pass `recency` and `Date().timeIntervalSince1970` into every `CommandPaletteFuzzyScorer.score(…)` call when filtering.

Add to `CommandPaletteFeatureTests`:

- Activating `"openSettings"` bumps `recency["app.open-settings"]`.
- 201st activation evicts the oldest entry.
- Recency for a stale `worktree.select.<uuid>` ID is dropped when the worktree is deleted and palette reopened.

Verify: same test suite plus a manual pass where ⌘P → Settings → close → ⌘P shows "Open Settings" at the top of the empty-query list.

### Milestone 5 — Full command set + ghostty hook

Expand `CommandPaletteItems.build(forSelection:editor:catalog:)` to emit every `Kind`:

- Always: `openSettings`, `checkForUpdates`, `openSpaceManager`, one `selectSpace(id)` per `catalog.spaces`, one `switchToSpaceAtIndex(n)` for n=1…min(9, spaces.count).
- When `selection.worktreeID != nil`: `toggleGitViewer`, `closeCurrentWorktree` (flagged `hiddenWhenQueryEmpty = true`), `refreshCurrentWorktree`, `openCurrentWorktreeInDefaultEditor`, `revealCurrentWorktreeInFinder`, one `openCurrentWorktreeIn(editorID)` per installed descriptor in `editor.descriptors`.
- When `selection.worktreeID != nil`: pane actions — one `panelAction(.newTab)`, one per `NewSplitDirection`, one per `FocusDirection` as `panelAction(.gotoSplit(direction:))`, `panelAction(.closeTab(.this))` (hidden-when-empty), `panelAction(.equalizeSplits)`, `panelAction(.toggleSplitZoom)`.
- Always: window actions — `windowAction(.new(from: resolvedPanelID))`, `windowAction(.close(from: resolvedPanelID))`, `windowAction(.toggleFullscreen(from: resolvedPanelID))`, `windowAction(.toggleTabOverview(from: resolvedPanelID))`. When no pane is focused, these items are omitted rather than emitting synthetic IDs.

Items whose Kind requires a focused `PaneID` resolve it at build time via a new helper `resolveFocusedPanelID(selection:catalog:) -> PaneID?` that walks Tab→selectedPanelID. If `nil`, the corresponding items are not emitted.

Extend `RootFeature.route(_:)` to cover all Kinds. Each case is 1–4 lines, dispatching into an existing feature action. A typical block:

```swift
case .selectSpace(let id):
  return .send(.sidebar(.spaceRowTapped(id)))
case .switchToSpaceAtIndex(let n):
  return .send(.switchToSpaceAtIndex(n))
case .toggleGitViewer:
  return .send(.gitViewerToggledForCurrentWorktree)
case .openCurrentWorktreeInDefaultEditor:
  return .send(.openDefaultForCurrentWorktreeRequested)
case .openCurrentWorktreeIn(let editorID):
  // Build a worktree-path resolver inline or reuse RootFeature.projectOverrideEditorID
  …
case .panelAction(let req):
  guard let paneID = resolveFocusedPanelID(selection: state.selection,
                                            catalog: hierarchyClient.snapshot()) else { return .none }
  return .send(.panelActionRouter(.requested(paneID, req)))
case .windowAction(let req):
  return .send(.windowActionRouter(.requested(req)))
```

Replace the current `panelActionRouter(.delegate)` no-op at `RootFeature.swift:421`:

```swift
case .panelActionRouter(.delegate(.commandPaletteToggleRequested)):
  return .send(.commandPaletteToggle)
case .panelActionRouter(.delegate(.presentTerminalRequested)):
  return .none  // unchanged
case .panelActionRouter(.delegate):
  return .none
```

Verify: add a contract test `RootFeatureCommandPaletteRoutingTests` that iterates every `Kind` case (using a helper `Kind.allFixtureCases` returning one representative value per case) and asserts the reducer emits exactly one downstream action of the expected type. This is the regression net that catches future renames.

### Milestone 6 — Tests + Manual QA + PR

Final test passes:

- `CommandPaletteItemsTests` — synthetic catalog with (0 spaces / 1 space / 2 spaces × 0 projects / 2 projects × 0 worktrees / 1 worktree selected) produces the expected item IDs.
- `CommandPaletteFeatureTests` — toggle / query / selectionMoved / selectionCommitted / rowTapped / catalogChanged.
- `RootFeatureCommandPaletteRoutingTests` — exhaustive Kind coverage.
- `CommandPaletteFuzzyScorerTests` — ranking + recency + quoted-query.

Manual QA matrix:

- `⌘P` opens palette in every main-window state (no space / no worktree / worktree selected).
- Type "settings" / "git" / "personal" / "new tab" / "split right" / "open in zed" — each yields the expected item at rank 1 and Enter executes it.
- Type garbage → "No matching commands" empty-state shows; Enter is silent; Esc closes.
- Close palette, reopen → recently-used commands float to the top.
- Delete a Space whose `selectSpace` command had recency, reopen → the stale recency entry is pruned (assert via `defaults read com.touch-code commandPaletteRecency`).
- Configure ghostty `toggle_command_palette` on a key combo → pressing it opens the palette.
- Open palette, then click into a terminal pane → palette dismisses; ghostty receives the click normally.

Run `make -C apps/mac lint` and `xcodebuild test -scheme touch-code -destination 'platform=macOS'` — all green.

Open a PR against `main` from the `feature/command-p` branch with the title `feat(palette): add Command Palette (⌘P)` and a summary that links to the design doc.

## Concrete Steps

From the repo root `/Users/wanggang/.prowl/repos/touch-code/feature/command-p`:

```
# M0 baseline
make -C apps/mac lint
xcodebuild build -scheme touch-code -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' 2>&1 | xcbeautify
```

Expected: lint exits 0, build succeeds. Record any pre-existing failures in Surprises & Discoveries.

```
# After each milestone
make -C apps/mac mac-check          # swift-format + swiftlint
xcodebuild test -scheme touch-code \
  -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' \
  -only-testing:touch-codeTests \
  -only-testing:TouchCodeCoreTests 2>&1 | xcbeautify
```

Expected: 0 failing tests. New test files appear in the output as they are added.

```
# M2 manual smoke
make -C apps/mac mac-run-app
# press ⌘P, type "set", press Enter → Settings window opens
# press ⌘P, type "git", press Enter → Git Viewer overlay toggles
```

```
# M5 ghostty hook smoke
# in ~/.config/ghostty/config (or per-worktree override):
#   keybind = ctrl+shift+p=toggle_command_palette
# then in a touch-code terminal pane, press ctrl+shift+p → palette opens
```

```
# M6 recency inspection
defaults read com.touch-code commandPaletteRecency
```

Expected: a dictionary mapping stable command IDs (e.g. `app.open-settings`) to Unix timestamps.

## Validation and Acceptance

The feature is accepted when all of the following are true:

1. Pressing `⌘P` in any main-window state opens the palette; pressing `Esc` or clicking the scrim dismisses it.
2. Typing a command name selects the expected top item for all of: `"settings"` → Open Settings; `"git"` → Toggle Git Viewer; one of the space names → Switch to that Space; `"new tab"` → Pane: New Tab; `"open in <editor>"` → Open Current Worktree in that editor (only when installed).
3. Pressing `Enter` on the top item executes it and dismisses the palette in the same tick.
4. Activating the same command three times in a session causes it to appear at the top of the empty-query list on the next open, and after relaunching the app.
5. Deleting a Worktree whose `worktree.select.<uuid>` had recency causes that recency entry to disappear on the next palette open (verified via `defaults read`).
6. A ghostty keybind bound to `toggle_command_palette` opens the palette; the existing `PaneActionRouterFeature.Delegate.commandPaletteToggleRequested` no longer no-ops at `RootFeature`.
7. `RootFeatureCommandPaletteRoutingTests` passes with every `Kind` case covered.
8. `CommandPaletteFuzzyScorerTests` passes; the scorer's ordering is deterministic on identical input.
9. No regression in lint or existing tests.

## Idempotence and Recovery

Every milestone's edits are additive. The feature can be disabled at any point by:

- Removing the `⌘P` menu button in `MainWindowCommands.swift` and
- Deleting the `if let paletteStore = …` block in `ContentView.swift`.

The remaining types, reducer, and scorer compile as inert code.

Recency data lives under UserDefaults key `commandPaletteRecency`. To reset during development:

```
defaults delete com.touch-code commandPaletteRecency
```

If a milestone's build fails, revert the milestone's edits and run `make -C apps/mac mac-check`; the tree returns to the previous green state.

Edits to existing files:

- `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/Root/RootFeature.swift` — ~50 lines added (State field, action cases, `.ifLet` composition, `route(_:)`, `resolveFocusedPanelID`, replace `line 421` no-op).
- `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Commands/MainWindowCommands.swift` — ~6 lines added (new Button, ⌘P binding, inserted at the top of `CommandGroup(after: .newItem)`).
- `apps/mac/touch-code/App/ContentView.swift` — ~6 lines added (overlay mount inside existing ZStack).

No edits expected to: `PaneActionRouterFeature.swift`, `PaneActionRequest.swift`, `WindowActionRequest.swift`, `HierarchyClient.swift`, `EditorFeature.swift`, `SettingsWindowPresenter`, `TouchCodeApp.swift`, `GhosttyActionDecoder.swift`.

    enum Direction: Equatable { case up, down }
    enum Delegate: Equatable { case activate(CommandPaletteItem.Kind) }

In `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/Root/RootFeature.swift`, extend:

```swift
@Presents var commandPalette: CommandPaletteFeature.State?

enum Action {
  // … existing cases
  case commandPaletteToggle
  case commandPalette(PresentationAction<CommandPaletteFeature.Action>)
}

// in body:
.ifLet(\.$commandPalette, action: \.commandPalette) {
  CommandPaletteFeature()
}

private func route(
  _ kind: CommandPaletteItem.Kind,
  state: inout State
) -> Effect<Action>

private func resolveFocusedPanelID(
  selection: HierarchySelection,
  catalog: Catalog
) -> PaneID?
```

No changes to `PaneActionRequest`, `WindowActionRequest`, `HierarchyClient`, `HierarchyManager`, or any `*Feature` outside CommandPalette / Root.

Dependencies:

- **The Composable Architecture** — already a target dependency; uses `@Reducer`, `@ObservableState`, `@Presents`, `@Shared(.appStorage(…))`, `Scope`, `.ifLet(_:action:)`, `PresentationAction`.
- **SwiftUI** — `ZStack`, `TextField`, `List`, `FocusState`, `.onKeyPress`, `.ultraThinMaterial`. All available on macOS 14+; the app's `Tuist.swift` already pins `compatibleXcodeVersions: .upToNextMajor("26.0")` which ships with macOS 14+ SDKs.
- **TouchCodeCore** — `PaneActionRequest`, `WindowActionRequest`, `Catalog`, `Space`, `Project`, `Worktree`, `SpaceID`, `ProjectID`, `WorktreeID`, `PaneID`, `TabID`. Imported, not modified.

No new third-party dependencies. No new Swift Package additions.
