# ExecPlan: Read-Only Git Viewer (C7) + External Editor Integration (C8)

**Status:** Draft
**Author:** Gump (with Claude)
**Date:** 2026-04-20

This is a living document. The Progress, Surprises & Discoveries, Decision Log, and Outcomes & Retrospective sections must be kept up to date as work proceeds.

## Purpose

After this plan lands, a contributor who `make mac-build && make mac-run-app` can inspect their Git state and hand off to their editor without leaving touch-code:

- Selecting any Git-backed Worktree in the sidebar surfaces a **read-only** viewer showing working-tree diff, staged diff, the last 100 commits, and the diff of any commit the user clicks. Keyboard navigation (`j`/`k`/`Tab`/`Enter`) works throughout. A 1 000-line diff renders in under 200 ms from the moment `git` returns; a 50 000-line diff is replaced by a placeholder with a one-click "Copy command" that produces `cd '<abs-path>' && git …` on the clipboard.
- A dropdown on the Worktree header ("Open in ▾") and a `tc open [--in <editor>] [<worktree>]` CLI both open the current Worktree **directory** in the user's default editor (VSCode / Cursor / Zed / Xcode / Sublime / Finder, or any user-defined template). The default is resolvable globally and per-Project; Settings exposes the registry with an installed/missing marker for each editor. Errors (editor CLI not on `PATH`, non-zero exit, 5-second timeout, unresolved Worktree in `tc open`) surface as toasts or CLI stderr — no silent fallthrough.
- Both features are wired to C2's `HierarchyManager` as pure consumers — they read `Worktree.path` and `Project.defaultEditor`, and they mutate nothing about the hierarchy. A crash, timeout, or malformed `git` output in one never affects the other.

This is the first plan that gives touch-code real workflow value beyond "a terminal orchestrator": a user can inspect changes and hop to their editor in-app, which closes the loop with a CLI coding-agent session.

## Progress

- [x] M1  — Pure data models in `TouchCodeCore` + `TouchCodeIPC` (Git + Editor value types; Codable round-trip tests; template/ID validators; placeholder error) — 2026-04-20
- [x] M2  — `touch-code/Git/` service layer (`GitService` protocol, `LiveGitService` with `Process`, `DiffParser`, `GitOutputParser`, env stripping, output caps, timeout, error surface) — 2026-04-20
- [x] M3  — `GitViewerFeature` TCA reducer + `GitServiceClient` DependencyKey + `EditorServiceFacade` placeholder + `TestStore`-driven reducer tests (no UI yet) — 2026-04-20
- [x] M4a — SwiftUI viewer shell (`GitViewerView`, `CommitLogView`, `FileChangeListView`, `UnifiedDiffView`, keyboard bindings, viewer-region wiring) — 2026-04-20
- [x] M4b — Snapshot harness (`swift-snapshot-testing`) + 50k-line cap `LargeDiffPlaceholderView` + POSIX-quoted Copy-command helper + filter state/view/`/` keybinding — 2026-04-20 (snapshot reference PNGs deferred to M4b.1 follow-up per DEC-20)
- [x] M5  — `touch-code/App/Clients/Editor/` service layer (`EditorService`, `EditorRegistry`, `PathProber`, `ProcessSpawner`, env whitelist, 5 s spawn contract) — 2026-04-20 (landed out of order; M3/M4 still block on 0002 M5 TCA bring-up)
- [x] M6  — `EditorFeature` TCA + Settings editor section + per-Project override + Worktree header `Open in ▾` button + `SettingsStore` wiring; deletes M3's `EditorServiceFacade` placeholder — 2026-04-20 (landed as M6a + M6b)
- [x] M7a — `editor.*` IPC wire types (`EditorOpenRequest`, `EditorOpenResponse`, `EditorDescribeResponse`, `EditorSetDefaultRequest`/`Response`) + `EditorIPCError` wire-safe codes in `TouchCodeIPC/Editor/`; the `tc open` CLI + `IPCClient` helper were landed by plan 0003 on `origin/worktree-design+c3-c4-hooks-cli` (see DEC-21) — 2026-04-20
- [x] M7b — `EditorHandlers` class under `touch-code/App/Features/Socket/` routes `editor.describe` / `editor.open` / `editor.setDefault` through `EditorClient` + `HierarchyClient`, maps `EditorError` → `EditorIPCError` at the handler boundary, and resolves Worktree via explicit `worktreeID` or `panelID` traversal of the catalog snapshot. 12-test `EditorHandlersTests` covers descriptor mapping, worktree resolution (both paths + all fail modes), error taxonomy, and per-Project setDefault writes. `MethodRouter` registration + `InMemoryIPCServer` end-to-end integration test deferred to post-0003-merge reconciliation (DEC-21) — 2026-04-20
- [ ] M8  — Measure baseline perf first, then cross-feature integration tests, performance smoke (1 000-line diff < 200 ms signpost), acceptance walkthrough, and doc clean-up (update `architecture.md` codemap, close Open Question #7)

Each unchecked entry will be updated with a completion timestamp in the form `— 2026-MM-DD` when the milestone lands (matching the convention established in `0002`).

## Surprises & Discoveries

- **Zig CDN deps prime required on every fresh worktree (M1, 2026-04-20).** A clean worktree generation failed on `deps.files.ghostty.org → uucode-0.2.0-…tar.gz` with HTTP 400 (Cloudflare rejecting Zig's std.http.Client TLS fingerprint — a known and documented condition in `apps/mac/scripts/prime-zig-cache.sh`). Resolution: run the primer once per worktree before `make mac-generate`. The primer uses curl + `zig fetch` to populate `.build/ghostty/.zig-global-cache/p/` with all 36 ghostty tarballs in a few minutes. This should become the first step of any future `make mac-bootstrap` enhancement.

- **Initial 1000-line diff parse baseline on M1 = p50 9.94 ms, p95 10.27 ms, max 10.31 ms (M8 groundwork, 2026-04-20).** Measured with the brand-new `DiffParsePerformanceBaselineTests` against `Tests/Performance/fixtures/diff-1000-lines.txt` (1 file, 500 context + 500 added + 500 removed body lines = 1 500 body-line block, 1 505 lines total). 50 samples, 5 warm-up discards, `ContinuousClock.Instant` measurement on an Apple Silicon M1. This is ~**8× under the 80 ms design ceiling** for the parse stage of the 200 ms whole-pipeline budget, leaving comfortable headroom for the reducer-dispatch + render budgets that M8 will add once TCA is in place. The measurement was captured via a temporary `performanceEnabled = true` override; the production test is env-gated (`TC_RUN_PERFORMANCE_TESTS=1`) per DEC-9, and the baseline artefact is gitignored.

- **M4b.1 option (a) NSWindow harness attempted, still crashes (2026-04-20).** DEC-20 proposed two workarounds for the `NSHostingView` + `List + @FocusState` record-mode crash. Option (a) — wrap the hosting view inside an `NSWindow.contentView` with an `objc_setAssociatedObject`-retained container so the window outlives the assertSnapshot call — was implemented in `GitViewerSnapshotTests.makeHostingView`. Record mode still crashes at `fatalErrorMessage` inside the Testing framework dispatch; the NSWindow context is necessary but insufficient. Option (b) — snapshot the three column subviews (`CommitLogView`, `FileChangeListView`, `UnifiedDiffView`) in isolation — is the next attempt and is now the definitive M4b.1 follow-up path. The NSWindow harness is kept because it's a correctness improvement for future per-column snapshots (they'll still need a window context for some subviews).

- **`xcodebuild test` does not forward shell environment to the test runner on Xcode 15+ (confirmed M8 groundwork, 2026-04-20).** Already noted in DEC-9 for the Git integration tests; confirmed again here. `xcodebuild test ... ENV=value` sets build settings, not test-runtime env. The `-test-env` CLI flag (mentioned in some docs) is not available in our xcodebuild. Workarounds: (a) set env in the scheme's Test Action via Tuist's `testAction:` API (cleanest long-term; pending plan item), (b) temporarily relax the `.enabled(if:)` gate when capturing a one-shot baseline, (c) run the test binary under `xcrun xctest` with env inline (requires host-app rpath resolution, not worth the cycles). We took path (b) for the M8 groundwork baseline.

## Decision Log

- **DEC-1 (pre-M1, 2026-04-20): M3 facade throws `EditorPlaceholderError.notYetImplemented` rather than `fatalError` or a no-op.** Three options were considered. (a) Throw a dedicated `EditorPlaceholderError.notYetImplemented` added to `TouchCodeCore/Editor/` in M1 — **chosen**. Pro: the UI path is complete (error → toast) from M3 onward; no crash if an early build of M3 ships before M5. Con: adds one enum case that becomes unused after M5. (b) Return a synthetic `EditorChoiceDTO` as if success — rejected: the user would see "success" but no editor would open, which is a worse lie than a surfaced error. (c) `fatalError` in `liveValue` — rejected: violates the project's no-crash-in-UI-paths discipline and forces callers to guard against a placeholder in a way that would leak into the real code.
- **DEC-2 (pre-M4, 2026-04-20): Snapshot harness is `pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing`, pinned in `apps/mac/Tuist/Package.swift`.** Rejected alternatives: Apple's newer Swift Testing snapshot helpers (not yet broadly adopted in our reference projects; churn risk on macOS 15 image APIs) and hand-rolled `XCTAssertEqual(view.snapshot, fixture)` (reinvents the harness). Point-Free's library matches the TCA stack we already pulled in via `swift-composable-architecture`, runs under XCTest, and supports both `ViewImageConfig` and `PreviewLayout` — enough for M4b. The dep is added once in M4b; no M3/M5 dependency.
- **DEC-3 (pre-M7, 2026-04-20): M7 is split into M7a (IPC wire types + `tc open` parser + `IPCClient` helper) and M7b (`SocketServer` dispatch of `editor.*`).** M7a has zero socket-server dependency and is fully unit-testable via a fake `IPCClient`. M7b requires a `SocketServer` implementation; the plan of record is that `SocketServer` lands in the in-flight C3+C4 exec plan (to be numbered `0003-hooks-and-cli.md`) currently being drafted in a sibling worktree. If `0003`'s SocketServer has not landed by the time M7b is ready, M7b itself lands a narrow editor-only dispatcher under `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/Socket/` and records the fallback in this Decision Log so the C3+C4 plan knows to generalise rather than reimplement. No reverse dependency: C3+C4 does not need anything from this plan.
- **DEC-4 (pre-M1, 2026-04-20): Multiple commits per milestone, not one-per-milestone.** This plan follows the existing `0002` convention and the user's per-small-feature commit cadence (see [feedback memory](../../.claude/projects/-Users-wanggang-dev-00-touch-code/memory/feedback_commit_cadence.md)). Each "Expected commits" line corresponds to one independently-buildable, test-passing chunk. The /commit skill invocation cadence remains "after each small feature change", not "after each milestone". Review-round feedback suggesting 1-commit/milestone was declined on this basis.
- **DEC-5 (M1, 2026-04-20): One `TouchCodeIPC` DTO round-trip test hosted in `TouchCodeCoreTests`, not a new `TouchCodeIPCTests` target.** The plan specified a single test (both variants of `EditorInstallationStatusDTO`). Standing up a dedicated Tuist test target for one file would cost more than it protects. Added `TouchCodeIPC` as a dependency of `TouchCodeCoreTests`; the new `EditorIPCTypesTests.swift` sits beside the existing Codable tests. A future ExecPlan that adds substantial IPC coverage (e.g. 0003 for C3+C4) should promote the tests to their own target; at that point update this Decision Log accordingly.
- **DEC-6 (M2, 2026-04-20): Rename `whitelist` → `allowlist` and `forbidden` naming retained.** The project's `.swiftlint.yml` enables the `inclusive_language` rule. The 0005 design doc uses the term "whitelist" in prose; this plan continues to use it in the doc, but the *Swift API* in `GitProcessEnv` (and, in M5, `EditorEnv`) uses `allowlist`. Tests renamed accordingly (`allowlistedKeysPropagate`, `resultContainsOnlyAllowlistAndForced`, `missingAllowlistedKeysOmittedRatherThanEmpty`). The `forbidden` naming is retained since SwiftLint does not flag it.
- **DEC-7 (M2, 2026-04-20): `DiffParser.FileBuilder.consumeHeaderLine` split into three sub-handlers to satisfy the cyclomatic-complexity lint.** Rather than disable the linter inline (which tripped the adjacent `orphaned_doc_comment` / `superfluous_disable_command` rules), factored the `hasPrefix` cascade into `consumeModeLine`, `consumeRenameOrCopyLine`, and `consumeBinaryOrDiffHeaderLine`. Each sub-handler is small, still mirrors git's documented grammar, and the public entry point reads as a short decision tree. Net line count increased slightly; readability gain justifies the split.
- **DEC-8 (M2, 2026-04-20): `touch-code/Git/` types declared `nonisolated` explicitly.** The `touch-code` app target has `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor` (workspace-wide default for UI code). Pure helpers (`GitProcessEnv`, `GitCommand`, `DiffParser`, `GitOutputParser`, `Git`, `GitError`) and the `GitService` protocol + `LiveGitService` conformance are explicitly `nonisolated` so they (a) compose with `Sendable` cleanly and (b) can be called from any actor, including `nonisolated` test contexts. This matches the pattern `TouchCodeCore` uses at the module level (with `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = nonisolated` on that target) and is the per-declaration equivalent for app-target code that should stay actor-independent.
- **DEC-9 (M2, 2026-04-20): Integration tests gated via Swift Testing's `.enabled(if:)` trait, not a thrown skip error.** Initial attempt used `throw SkipTest.notEnabled` at the top of each `@Test` function — Swift Testing 1.x interprets that as a failure, not a skip. Switched to `@Test(.enabled(if: integrationEnabled))` reading `ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["TC_RUN_GIT_INTEGRATION_TESTS"] == "1"`. Note that `xcodebuild test` does not forward shell environment to the test runner by default; engineers enable integration tests by setting the env var in Xcode's scheme (Test action → Environment Variables) or by running tests from a terminal that exports the var before invoking Xcode. The tests themselves are correctly gated and skip cleanly in default CI runs.
- **DEC-10 (M2-fix, 2026-04-20): Introduced `CommandRunner` protocol as a testability seam in `touch-code/Git/`.** Review feedback on `LiveGitService` flagged two races in the inline `Foundation.Process` plumbing (termination-handler assigned inside `Task.detached`; pipe drains on the cooperative pool). Fixed by (a) installing the handler synchronously before `process.run()` via `AsyncStream.makeStream()`, and (b) moving pipe drains to `DispatchQueue.global(qos: .utility)`. Both fixes live in a new `FoundationCommandRunner` (the default) + `RecordingCommandRunner` (test double). `LiveGitService` now calls the runner protocol, which enables negative-path unit tests (`LiveGitServiceRunnerTests` covers `.timedOut` / `.outputTooLarge` / `.exec` / `.notARepo` / `.gitMissing` / invalid-SHA rejection / env-allowlist assertions) without a real git subprocess. The same race + drain fix was applied in-place to `FoundationProcessSpawner` in the editor module (M5), kept module-local rather than shared to preserve the touch-code/Git ↔ touch-code/App/Clients/Editor boundary.
- **DEC-11 (M2-fix, 2026-04-20): `.notARepo` detection via `rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`, not stderr substring match.** Every `GitService` entry point now starts with `ensureIsRepo(at:)` — a separate `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` call whose exit code authoritatively reports repo-ness. Stderr substring matching retained only as a narrow fallback (`fatal: not a git repository` + `fatal: bad revision` + `fatal: Not a valid object name`) for the race where the worktree vanishes between pre-check and actual command. Default `gitExecutable` changed from `/usr/bin/env` (PATH-dependent) to `/usr/bin/git` (absolute) — removing a small PATH-attack surface that the env allowlist otherwise closed at the subprocess boundary. `git show <sha>` now appends `--` after the SHA to close the SHA-vs-path argv ambiguity per git's documented grammar.
- **DEC-12 (M2-fix, 2026-04-20): `GitOutputParser` throws `.unparsable` on unparseable commit dates, not epoch-0 fallback.** A silent fallback would render `1970-01-01` in the UI whenever git emits an unexpected date shape; failing loudly surfaces the real problem. Also added `-c core.quotePath=false` to every argv that returns paths (log / diff / show / status) so non-ASCII paths arrive as UTF-8 rather than octal-escaped by git's default quoting.
- **DEC-13 (pre-M5, 2026-04-20): M5 landed out of order before M3/M4/M4a/M4b.** Those milestones require TCA wired in `Tuist/Package.swift`, which is a deliverable of the in-flight `0002 M5` plan. M5 (editor service layer) has no TCA dependency — its service protocol, registry, prober, spawner, and models live under `touch-code/App/Clients/Editor/` but don't import TCA. Landing M5 now means the next review cycle has both service-layer slices (Git from M2 + Editor from M5) available for end-to-end integration planning, rather than waiting for `0002 M5`. M3/M4/M6/M7a/M7b/M8 still require TCA and remain paused.
- **DEC-14 (M5, 2026-04-20): `LiveEditorService` uses concrete-return-not-`async` for `describe` / `resolve`.** The `EditorService` protocol declares both as `async` so a future path-probing implementation can do disk I/O off the main actor. The M5 live implementation is synchronous (registry merge is in-memory), and SwiftLint's `async_without_await` rule flags bare-async methods. Swift permits a sync method to satisfy an async protocol requirement — dropped `async` from the live + test impls; callers still write `await service.describe()` with the actor-hop semantics intact. The `TestEditorService` follows the same shape for the same reason.
- **DEC-15 (M5.1, 2026-04-20): `PathProber` caching deferred to M6.** `LiveEditorService.describe()` rebuilds the registry and re-probes `$PATH` on every call — there is no cache at M5. The design's cache + refresh triggers (settings-open, custom-editor edit, `editor.describe` IPC) require a mutable `@Observable` cache that M6's `EditorFeature` owns alongside its Settings-UI refresh actions. Documented here so the M5.1 review surface doesn't lose the deferred work. M6 lands `CachingPathProber` (or an equivalent layer inside `LiveEditorService`) plus the three refresh triggers.
- **DEC-16 (M5.1, 2026-04-20): Finder fallback in `LiveEditorService.resolve` prefers installed over missing.** C8 review flagged that a naive `registry.first { $0.id == "finder" }` returns Finder even when `.missingBinary` — the dropdown would then label a broken editor as the resolved default. Fix: search for an installed-and-Finder descriptor first; fall back to a missing-Finder descriptor only if the installed one doesn't exist. In practice `/usr/bin/open` is always on macOS, so the installed branch always wins; the fallback documents the semantics and keeps `open()`'s `.notInstalled` path correct if Finder somehow goes missing.
- **DEC-17 (M8 groundwork, 2026-04-20): `pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing` pinned at `from: "1.17.0"` in `apps/mac/Tuist/Package.swift`.** Resolved eagerly (M8 groundwork) rather than waiting for M4b so the dependency surface stabilises before TCA-dependent work starts. No target depends on it yet — M4b adds the test-target wiring. DEC-2 originally committed to this library; DEC-17 pins the exact floor version.
- **DEC-18 (M8 groundwork, 2026-04-20): Performance baseline: 50 samples with 5 warm-ups discarded, P95-asserted, per-machine.** Refined from "10 samples" in the original plan. 10 samples are statistically insufficient for a stable P95 under ARC / cache / scheduler variance. 5 warm-up samples drop the cold-cache outliers. Baseline is per-machine gitignored — each contributor and CI runner captures its own. Assertion uses `max(designBudget, baseline.p95 × 1.25)` so the design-ceiling stays the upper bound even when a faster machine produces a tighter baseline. `TC_PERF_BASELINE=capture` environment variable distinguishes capture mode from assert mode so a baseline refresh is intentional.
- **DEC-19 (M4a.1, 2026-04-20): `git show <sha>` argv places `-w` before `--`, not after.** The M4a cut of `GitCommand.diff` appended `-w` via `base + ["-w"]` after the `.commit` base already ended with `sha, "--"`. Git treats everything after `--` as pathspec, so the flag became a silent filter for a path literally named `-w` rather than enabling ignore-whitespace. Fix rewrote the builder to accumulate into a mutable `args` array, splicing `-w` before the trailing `sha, "--"` pair. New `GitCommandTests.commitDiffWithIgnoreWhitespacePlacesFlagBeforeDashDash` locks the ordering contract; every `DiffKind` case is exercised. The M3 review's `whitespaceToggleReissuesDiffWithFlagPassedThrough` test only proved the Bool reached the client — which is why the argv bug slipped through initially. Lesson: plumb-through tests must reach the last observable boundary (argv), not just the penultimate one (protocol closure).
- **DEC-20 (M4b, 2026-04-20): Snapshot reference PNGs deferred to M4b.1 follow-up.** The M4b landing wires the full snapshot infrastructure: `SnapshotTesting` dep in `Tuist/Package.swift`, `SnapshotTesting` dependency on the `touch-codeTests` target, `GitViewerSnapshotTests.swift` with 6 fixture-generated tests (log populated, working diff 10 files, commit diff rename+binary+added, `.notARepo` empty state, `.diffTooLarge` placeholder with a space in the path, `.exec` error in the file list), and an `NSHostingView`-based `makeHostingView` helper. **Reference PNGs are not checked in**: a record-mode dry run crashed because `NSHostingView` renders `List` + `@FocusState` without a presentation-window context. Generating the baseline either (a) hosts the view inside a dummy `NSWindow` in a harness helper, or (b) snapshots individual column subviews (`CommitLogView`, `FileChangeListView`, `UnifiedDiffView`) instead of the composite viewer — both are proper M4b.1 work. Tests are env-gated (`TC_RUN_SNAPSHOT_TESTS=1`) and skip cleanly in default runs.
- **DEC-21 (M7, 2026-04-20): `MethodRouter` registration of `editor.*` handlers deferred to post-0003-merge reconciliation.** Plan 0003 (C3+C4 hooks-and-CLI) has CLOSED on `origin/worktree-design+c3-c4-hooks-cli` but has not yet merged to `main`. That branch ships the `SocketServer`, `MethodRouter`, `InMemoryIPCServer`, the `tc open` CLI, and reserves the `editor.open` method slot (via their M7.1 reconciliation commit 3cf35a5). On this branch, landing only the app-side handler class (`EditorHandlers`) + wire types + error codes lets us validate the handler in isolation (12 tests, all green) without pulling in the full socket stack, which has a divergent repo layout versus ours (the 0003 branch was cut pre-`apps/mac` refactor 307712). The MethodRouter wiring is a mechanical two-line drop-in at merge time: `router.register(.editorOpen) { try await handlers.open(...) }` plus equivalents for `.editorDescribe` and `.editorSetDefault`. The M7b "narrow fallback dispatcher" path from DEC-3 is NOT implemented — a temporary SocketServer stub would be overwritten at merge time and would exercise code the final plan discards. **Reconciliation checklist at merge time:** (a) import `TouchCodeIPC.IPC.Method` enum from 0003 (or merge our `EditorIPCMethod` constants into it), (b) instantiate `EditorHandlers` in `AppBootstrap` with `EditorClient` + `HierarchyClient` from the live dependency container, (c) register the three methods on the shared `MethodRouter`, (d) add one integration test that round-trips `editor.open` through `InMemoryIPCServer` asserting the handler's `EditorIPCError.spawnFailed` → `IPCError` mapping. The M8 performance + acceptance tests assume this wiring is live.

## Outcomes & Retrospective

### M1 — Pure data models (2026-04-20)

**What landed:**
- `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Git/` — `GitModels.swift` (Commit + computed `shortID`, DiffScope, UnifiedDiff, FileChange + Kind, DiffHunk, DiffLine + Kind, LogPage + Cursor, WorkingTreeStatus + Entry with custom `Character` Codable), `GitShaValidator.swift` (accept 7..64 hex, case-insensitive; reject non-hex/whitespace/empty/overlong).
- `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Editor/` — `EditorStorageModels.swift` (EditorID typealias, CommandTemplate with `dirPlaceholder = "{dir}"` constant, CustomEditor), `EditorValidators.swift` (CommandTemplate.validate throwing EditorTemplateError; CustomEditor.validatedID enforcing `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{1,31}` via scalar iteration), `EditorPlaceholderError.swift` (single case `.notYetImplemented` for the M3 facade).
- `apps/mac/TouchCodeIPC/Editor/` — `EditorIPCTypes.swift` (EditorDescriptorDTO + Origin, EditorChoiceDTO, EditorInstallationStatusDTO), `EditorIPCMethods.swift` (three `editor.*` string constants).
- `apps/mac/TouchCodeCoreTests/` — `GitModelsCodableTests.swift` (20 tests: shortID SHA-1/SHA-256, every FileChange.Kind, DiffLine.Kind parity, DiffScope variants, LogPage merge + root + pagination, WorkingTreeStatus entries + UTF-8 paths), `GitShaValidatorTests.swift` (10 tests), `EditorValidatorsTests.swift` (17 tests covering template validation + ID regex boundaries), `EditorIPCTypesTests.swift` (2 tests, both DTO variants).
- `apps/mac/Project.swift` — `TouchCodeCoreTests` now also depends on `TouchCodeIPC` (see DEC-5).

**Verification:** `xcodebuild test -scheme TouchCodeCore` → 80 tests in 7 suites, all passed in 0.178 s. `make mac-lint` clean. Grep for platform imports under `TouchCodeCore` / `TouchCodeIPC` returned zero matches.

**Surprises:** Workspace regeneration initially blocked on the Zig CDN (same flaky 400 as 0001 DEC-8). Resolved by running `apps/mac/scripts/prime-zig-cache.sh` to seed `.build/ghostty/.zig-global-cache/p/` via `curl`-then-`zig-fetch`. Captured in Surprises & Discoveries so M2+ sessions remember the primer step.

**Carry-forward to M2:** All domain types M2 needs (Commit, UnifiedDiff, FileChange, DiffHunk, DiffLine, LogPage, WorkingTreeStatus) are stable and tested. `GitShaValidator.isValid` is ready to gate `git show <sha>` invocations. Adding `GitError` in M2 is purely additive over the M1 surface.

### M2 — Git service layer (2026-04-20)

**What landed:**
- `apps/mac/touch-code/Git/` — `GitService.swift` (protocol, `nonisolated` + `Sendable`), `GitCommand.swift` (argv builder with the design's exact argument lists), `GitProcessEnv.swift` (allowlist `PATH`/`HOME`, forced `LC_ALL=C.UTF-8`, forbidden `GIT_*` keys, debug-only precondition), `LiveGitService.swift` (Process-backed implementation with 16 MiB output cap, 10 s timeout, SIGTERM→SIGKILL escalation, `notARepo` detection), `DiffParser.swift` (unified-diff state machine with added/deleted/modified/renamed/copied/typeChanged/binary/mode-only/no-newline-at-EOF classification, 50 000-line cutoff), `GitOutputParser.swift` (null-delimited log parser supporting SHA-1/SHA-256, merges, roots, UTF-8 names; porcelain-v1 `-z` status parser with rename/copy handling), `GitError.swift` (seven-case error enum). `Git.swift` namespace now exposes `Git.makeService()` factory.
- `apps/mac/touch-code/Tests/GitTests/` — `DiffParserTests.swift` (15 tests covering every FileChange.Kind, hunk header variants, empty-new-file, no-newline-at-EOF, multiple files, 50 001-line cap), `GitOutputParserTests.swift` (11 tests covering linear/merge/root/UTF-8 logs + clean/mixed/rename/UTF-8 status), `GitProcessEnvTests.swift` (6 tests locking whitelist, forced, SHELL-stripping, forbidden-stripping, result composition, missing-parent behaviour), `LiveGitServiceIntegrationTests.swift` (5 tests gated by `.enabled(if: TC_RUN_GIT_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1)` — logs, diffs, status against a scratch repo).

**Verification:** `xcodebuild test -scheme touch-code` → 43 tests in 5 suites, all passed in 5.578 s (integration tests correctly skipped). `make mac-lint` clean after rename + refactor.

**Surprises:**
- The app target defaults to `@MainActor`. Pure helpers had to be marked `nonisolated` explicitly (DEC-8). Nested types (`FileBuilder`, `HunkBuilder`, `HunkHeader`) also need per-declaration `nonisolated` — the enclosing enum's attribute does not propagate.
- SwiftLint's `inclusive_language` rule caught `whitelist` in both source and tests; renamed to `allowlist` (DEC-6).
- `consumeHeaderLine` hit the `cyclomatic_complexity` 15-branch ceiling. Inline disable pragmas tripped `orphaned_doc_comment` / `superfluous_disable_command`; refactored into three sub-handlers (DEC-7) — cleaner than fighting the linter.
- Swift Testing's `.enabled(if:)` is the right gate; a thrown skip error reads as a failure (DEC-9). `xcodebuild test` does not forward shell env to the test runner — documented in DEC-9 so the next engineer knows to set it via scheme.

**Carry-forward to M3:** `GitService` protocol + `LiveGitService` factory are ready for `GitServiceClient` (DependencyKey). The `.enabled(if:)` pattern + `ProcessInfo` env-var check is the template for future integration-test gates in this plan.

### M5 — Editor service layer (2026-04-20, landed out of order)

**What landed:**
- `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Clients/Editor/` — `EditorService.swift` (protocol), `EditorService+Live.swift` (LiveEditorService, four-tier resolution with no silent fallthrough, argv construction via `{dir}` substitution), `EditorService+Test.swift` (in-memory TestEditorService actor), `EditorRegistry.swift` (exact 6-entry allowlist + merge-with-customs), `EditorModels.swift` (EditorDescriptor + EditorChoice + InstallationStatus + DTO bridges), `EditorError.swift` (7 cases matching the design), `ProcessSpawner.swift` (protocol + FoundationProcessSpawner with the same race + drain fix from DEC-10 + RecordingProcessSpawner actor test double), `PathProber.swift` (protocol + LivePathProber + FakePathProber), `EditorEnv.swift` (PATH/HOME allowlist, LC_ALL forced, SHELL/EDITOR/VISUAL/GIT_* forbidden — `SHELL` explicitly in forbidden per C8 v2), `SpawnContract.swift` (5 s timeout + 1 s SIGTERM grace constants).
- `apps/mac/touch-code/Tests/EditorTests/` — `EditorRegistryTests.swift` (9 tests locking the 6-entry table + custom-merge + ID-collision rejection), `PathProberTests.swift` (5 tests), `EditorServiceResolutionTests.swift` (6 tests covering the four-tier fallback chain + the critical no-silent-fallthrough assertion), `EditorServiceSpawnTests.swift` (10 tests covering argv per built-in, `{dir}` literal substitution, env allowlist, cwd, exit 0 / non-zero / timeout / spawn-failed / not-a-directory branches), `EditorEnvTests.swift` (6 tests symmetric to GitProcessEnvTests).

**Verification:** `xcodebuild test -scheme touch-code` → 90 tests in 13 suites, all passed in 5.57 s. `make mac-lint` clean.

**Carry-forward to M6 + M7:** Service protocol + registry + test spawner are ready. M6 wires `EditorClient` (DependencyKey) around `LiveEditorService`; the live factory closes over `SettingsStore` + `HierarchyManager` reads. M7a maps `editor.open` IPC to `LiveEditorService.open` via the `EditorChoice.toDTO()` / `EditorDescriptor.toDTO()` bridges already in place.

## Context and Orientation

Related documents (all in this repo):

- **Product spec** — [docs/product-spec.md](../product-spec.md), capabilities C7 and C8; Open Question #7 (editor discovery) is resolved by C8.
- **Design docs — authoritative for every decision; this plan implements, it does not relitigate:**
  - [docs/design-docs/c7-git-viewer.md](../design-docs/c7-git-viewer.md)
  - [docs/design-docs/c8-editor-integration.md](../design-docs/c8-editor-integration.md)
- **Architecture** — [docs/architecture.md](../architecture.md). Relevant invariants: hybrid TCA + `@Observable` with TCA for feature flows; atomic-rename JSON with top-level `version`; `tc` is stateless and talks to the app over `TouchCodeIPC`; all identifiers are UUIDs.
- **Upstream plan — prerequisite for M3–M8:** [docs/exec-plans/0002-terminal-and-hierarchy.md](0002-terminal-and-hierarchy.md). M2 of that plan has landed (`CatalogStore`, `HierarchyManager`); M3–M6 are pending and bring up `GhosttyKit`, `TerminalEngine`, TCA wiring, the sidebar, and Git worktree operations. M3 of *this* plan (the first TCA-touching milestone) must not start before 0002's M5 has added TCA to `Tuist/Package.swift`.

Reference projects (read-only; borrow first, deviate with a stated reason):

- **supacode** — `/Users/wanggang/dev/opensource/supacode`
  - `supacode/Clients/Git/GitClient.swift` — shell-out `git` pattern (only aggregate line counts today; we generalise the shape)
  - `supacode/Clients/Workspace/WorkspaceClient.swift` — Launch-Services editor open (rejected as primary mechanism in C8 A1; we use `Process` wrappers)
  - `supacode/SupacodeSettingsShared/Domain/OpenWorktreeAction.swift` — shape of the allowlist enum (we take the *shape*, not the LS mechanism)
  - `supacode/Clients/Terminal/TerminalClient.swift` — the `DependencyKey` pattern we reuse for `GitServiceClient` and `EditorClient`
- **supaterm** — `/Users/wanggang/dev/opensource/supaterm` (no editor or git viewer code; confirmed during design)

Repository state at plan start:

- `apps/mac/Project.swift` already defines `TouchCodeCore`, `TouchCodeCoreTests`, `TouchCodeIPC`, `GhosttyKit` (foreignBuild, currently enabled via `0002 DEC-8` follow-up), `tc`, `touch-code`, `touch-codeTests`.
- `apps/mac/touch-code/Git/` contains exactly one file: `Git.swift` with `public enum Git {}`. Every Git-module source in M2 lands here.
- `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Clients/` does not yet exist. It is created by this plan (first by `0002 M5` for `HierarchyClient` / `TerminalClient`; this plan adds `GitServiceClient.swift` and `Editor/` alongside).
- `apps/mac/TouchCodeIPC/IPC.swift` contains `public enum IPC {}` only. M7 is the first substantive content.
- `apps/mac/tc/main.swift` is the ArgumentParser root with only a `--version` print. M7 adds the first subcommand.

**Terminology used in this plan** (defined once; used as-is below):

- **C7 viewer** / **viewer** — the read-only Git diff + log surface specified in `c7-git-viewer.md`.
- **C8 editor service** / **editor service** — `EditorService` and its allowlist; specified in `c8-editor-integration.md`.
- **Scope** — the viewer's mode enum: `.working` (working-tree diff), `.staged` (staged diff), `.log` (paginated commit list), `.commit(sha:)` (diff of a specific commit). Defined as `DiffScope` in Swift since a `Scope` identifier is too generic.
- **Worktree-scoped state** — feature state that invalidates when the selected `WorktreeID` changes. The viewer is worktree-scoped; the editor service is not (it is a pure function of its inputs).
- **Fire-and-forget** — *not used.* The C8 design explicitly removed the fire-and-forget heuristic during review (see `c8-editor-integration.md` §Spawn contract, Resolved Item #6). The spawn contract is: wait up to 5 s for the child; exit 0 → success; non-zero exit → `.nonZeroExit`; still running at 5 s → `.timedOut` (SIGTERM then SIGKILL).
- **`{dir}` substitution** — the literal four-character token `{dir}` inside a `CommandTemplate.args` array, replaced at spawn time with the absolute Worktree path. Substitution is at the argv-slot level; there is no shell, no quoting, no expansion.
- **POSIX-quoted path** — `'…'` single-quoted with internal `'` rewritten as `'\''`. Applied only to the path inside a `cd`-prefixed Copy-command string on the clipboard; never to argv.

**Orientation paragraph.** The plan slices vertically where each slice is user-visible, and horizontally where a shared data layer needs a separate acceptance bar. M1 is a horizontal foundation (pure types, no UI) that both features draw from, because both want the same Codable/Equatable/Sendable guarantees and the same test story. M2 and M5 are the two "service layer" slices — one per feature, each ending with a service that can be driven from tests without any UI. M3/M4 then build C7's TCA feature then its SwiftUI view, ending at the moment the user sees a working viewer inside the app shell. M6 mirrors that for C8 with the Worktree-header button and Settings editor section. M7 extends to the CLI and IPC surface so `tc open` works from inside any Panel. M8 is the acceptance milestone: cross-feature integration tests, a performance smoke, and a dogfooding checklist. Each milestone produces at least one commit matching the repo's post-feature-commit cadence (per [Memory](../../.claude/projects/-Users-wanggang-dev-00-touch-code/memory/feedback_commit_cadence.md)).

## Plan of Work

### Milestone 1: Pure data models in TouchCodeCore + TouchCodeIPC

**Goal after this milestone.** Every Codable value type shared by C7, C8, and the IPC wire lives in the two leaf frameworks. `TouchCodeCore` holds the Git domain types and the editor-storage types (because `settings.json` persists them). `TouchCodeIPC` holds the two editor DTOs (`EditorDescriptor`, `EditorChoice`) the CLI deserialises from the socket. No file touches the app target. Zero imports of AppKit / SwiftUI / GhosttyKit / `Foundation.Process`.

This milestone is deliberately schema-heavy and logic-light. Its job is to pin every `Codable` shape before any runtime code depends on it, and to prove that validators (template, editor ID, SHA) are correct before a UI can mis-route bad input.

**Work.**

Under `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Git/` (new subfolder; the existing folder layout is flat, but per [architecture.md](../architecture.md) a Git subfolder is idiomatic), create:

- `GitModels.swift` — `Commit`, `DiffScope`, `UnifiedDiff`, `FileChange` (and nested `FileChange.Kind`), `DiffHunk`, `DiffLine` (and nested `DiffLine.Kind`), `LogPage` (and nested `LogPage.Cursor`), `WorkingTreeStatus` (and nested `WorkingTreeStatus.Entry`). All `public`, all `Equatable`, `Hashable` where it composes, `Sendable`, and `Codable`. `Commit.shortID` is a **computed property** (`String(id.prefix(7))`), per the design's review-round fix — never stored, always derived.
- `GitShaValidator.swift` — `public enum GitShaValidator { public static func isValid(_ s: String) -> Bool }` returning true iff `s` matches `^[0-9a-fA-F]{7,64}$`. Pure function. Callers: the service layer (M2) before issuing `git show <sha>` and the reducer (M3) before emitting `.commitSelected`.

Under `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Editor/` (new subfolder), create:

- `EditorStorageModels.swift` — `public typealias EditorID = String`, `public struct CommandTemplate: Equatable, Sendable, Codable { let binary: String; let args: [String] }`, `public struct CustomEditor: Equatable, Sendable, Codable, Identifiable { var id: EditorID; var displayName: String; var template: CommandTemplate }`.
- `EditorValidators.swift` — two validators: `CustomEditor.validatedID(_:) throws -> EditorID` (matches `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{1,31}$` per design Resolved Item #9), and `CommandTemplate.validate() throws` (non-empty `binary`; `args` contains **exactly one** literal `"{dir}"` element). Both throw a new `public enum EditorTemplateError: Error, Equatable { case emptyBinary; case missingDirPlaceholder; case duplicateDirPlaceholder; case invalidID(String) }`.
- `EditorPlaceholderError.swift` — **one** public case: `public enum EditorPlaceholderError: Error, Equatable { case notYetImplemented }`. This is the error the M3 `EditorServiceFacade.liveValue` throws before M5 lands the real service. It lives in `TouchCodeCore` so M3 can throw it without importing any app-tier type, and it stays after M5 deletes its only caller (benign, zero-site; optional M6 clean-up may remove it). Flagged in Decision Log (DEC-1).

Under `apps/mac/TouchCodeIPC/Editor/` (new subfolder), create:

- `EditorIPCTypes.swift` — `public struct EditorDescriptorDTO`, `public struct EditorChoiceDTO`, `public struct EditorInstallationStatusDTO` (enum with `.installed(resolvedBinary: URL)` and `.missingBinary(expected: String)`). These are the wire types returned from `editor.describe` and `editor.open`. Codable, Equatable, Sendable. No methods beyond initialisers.
- `EditorIPCMethods.swift` — `public enum EditorIPCMethod { public static let describe = "editor.describe"; public static let open = "editor.open"; public static let setDefault = "editor.setDefault" }`. String constants; the full JSON-RPC envelope lives in later plans (CLI design doc will pin that; we declare only the method names so `tc` and the app agree).

No Git IPC types in M1 (the design's Seam §`git.*` IPC namespace says the IPC surface is deferred to a later plan; we do not populate it).

Tests under `apps/mac/TouchCodeCoreTests/`:

- `GitModelsCodableTests.swift` — round-trip every struct with both minimal and fully populated fixtures. One fixture per `FileChange.Kind` case, one per `DiffLine.Kind` case, `LogPage` with a merge commit (two parents) and a root commit (zero parents). Assert `Commit.shortID == id.prefix(7)` for SHA-1 (40 chars) and SHA-256 (64 chars) inputs.
- `GitShaValidatorTests.swift` — accept: 7-char lowercase, 7-char uppercase, 40-char SHA-1, 64-char SHA-256. Reject: 6-char, 65-char, non-hex (`g`), empty, whitespace-padded.
- `EditorValidatorsTests.swift` — accept `CommandTemplate(binary: "code", args: ["{dir}"])`, `(binary: "open", args: ["-a", "Xcode", "{dir}"])`. Reject: empty binary, zero `{dir}` tokens, two `{dir}` tokens. Accept IDs `"vscode"`, `"my-editor"`, `"a_b_c"`; reject `"1abc"` (leading digit), `"Vscode"` (uppercase), `""`, `"a"` (too short — below 2-char minimum), and `"a" + String(repeating: "a", count: 32)` (33 chars — above the 32-char upper bound).

No tests for `TouchCodeIPC` DTOs in M1 beyond a single Codable round-trip covering both variants of `EditorInstallationStatusDTO`. (Deeper IPC tests arrive with M7.)

**Observable acceptance.** From the repo root, `make mac-generate && DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer xcodebuild test -workspace apps/mac/touch-code.xcworkspace -scheme TouchCodeCoreTests | xcbeautify` ends with `Test Suite 'All tests' passed` and the test count increases by the number of new cases above. `make mac-lint` is clean. A grep that would catch a regression: `grep -r 'import AppKit\|import SwiftUI\|import GhosttyKit\|import Foundation.Process' apps/mac/TouchCodeCore apps/mac/TouchCodeIPC` returns zero matches.

**Expected commit.** `feat(core): Git and editor data models + validators`.

### Milestone 2: Git service layer in touch-code/Git/

**Goal after this milestone.** A protocol-backed `GitService` exists in `touch-code/Git/`; a live implementation shells out to `git` with the design's exact argv, applies output caps and timeouts, strips `GIT_*` env, and returns the M1 value types. A pure `DiffParser` turns `git diff` bytes into a `UnifiedDiff`. A pure `GitOutputParser` turns null-delimited `git log` and `git status --porcelain=v1 -z` bytes into their M1 shapes. All of this runs under unit tests with no app-target dependency.

This milestone is a horizontal slice inside C7 only. It ends with a service we can drive from the reducer in M3 without touching any UI.

**Work.**

Under `apps/mac/touch-code/Git/`, create the files named in [c7-git-viewer.md §Component Boundaries](../design-docs/c7-git-viewer.md#component-boundaries):

- `GitService.swift` — the `public protocol GitService: Sendable` from the design (§API Design). Five async-throws methods: `log`, `workingTreeDiff`, `stagedDiff`, `commitDiff`, `status`.
- `GitCommand.swift` — `enum GitCommand { static func log(limit: Int, skip: Int) -> [String]; static func diff(kind: DiffKind, sha: String?, ignoreWhitespace: Bool) -> [String]; static func status() -> [String] }`. Produces argv arrays (without the leading executable) using the exact strings from the design doc §API Design table. `DiffKind` is a local enum (`.workingTree`, `.staged`, `.commit(sha:)`) hidden inside this file.
- `LiveGitService.swift` — the `Process`-backed implementation. Constructor takes a `gitExecutableURL: URL` (default `/usr/bin/env git` resolved to `/usr/bin/env` with `arguments: ["git", …]`). Each method: validate inputs (SHA via `GitShaValidator`); build argv via `GitCommand`; spawn `Process` with `currentDirectoryURL` set to the Worktree path; install pipes on stdout/stderr with the **16 MiB** cap (tracked in a `DataAccumulator` helper that rejects past-cap chunks with `GitError.outputTooLarge`); arm a **10 s** wall-clock timer via `Task.sleep` racing the process exit; on exit, if code != 0 → `.exec(code, stderr)`; on timeout → `process.terminate()` then `.timedOut`; on success, hand bytes to the parser layer.
- `GitProcessEnv.swift` — `enum GitProcessEnv { static let whitelist: [String] = ["PATH", "HOME"]; static let forced: [String: String] = ["LC_ALL": "C.UTF-8"]; static let forbidden: Set<String> = ["GIT_DIR", "GIT_WORK_TREE", "GIT_EDITOR", "GIT_PAGER", "GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF", "GIT_EXEC_PATH", "GIT_CONFIG", "GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM", "GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL", "GIT_SSH", "GIT_ASKPASS"]; static func build(from parent: [String: String]) -> [String: String] }`. The builder takes the current process env, filters to the whitelist, overlays `forced`, and asserts none of `forbidden` appear in the output. Used exclusively by `LiveGitService`.
- `DiffParser.swift` — `enum DiffParser { static func parse(_ bytes: Data, scope: DiffScope) throws -> UnifiedDiff }`. Pure. Consumes unified-diff output line-by-line (splitting on `\n`, respecting no-newline-at-eof with `\ No newline at end of file`), emits one `FileChange` per `diff --git a/… b/…` block, populates `Kind` from the `new file mode` / `deleted file mode` / `rename from/to` / `copy from/to` lines, and fills hunks from `@@` headers. Enforces the 50 000-line cutoff from the design: on the 50 001st parsed line, throw `GitError.diffTooLarge`.
- `GitOutputParser.swift` — two static methods: `parseLog(_ bytes: Data) throws -> [Commit]` (splits by `\x00`, reads six fields per commit) and `parseStatus(_ bytes: Data) throws -> WorkingTreeStatus` (porcelain-v1 `-z` parsing). Both pure.
- `GitModels+Git.swift` — `Git` namespace extensions that bridge M1 types to this module: mostly `internal` typealiases so the files above stay compact.
- `GitError.swift` — `public enum GitError: Error, Equatable { case notARepo; case gitMissing; case outputTooLarge; case diffTooLarge; case timedOut; case exec(code: Int32, stderr: String); case invalidInput(String) }`.

Update `Git.swift` (currently `public enum Git {}`) to re-export the service factory: `public extension Git { static func makeService(gitExecutable: URL? = nil) -> any GitService }`. No behaviour change for existing callers.

Tests under `apps/mac/touch-code/Tests/GitTests/` (new subfolder of the existing `touch-code/Tests/` which already hosts `HierarchyManagerTests.swift`; the `touch-codeTests` Tuist target's `buildableFolders` is `["touch-code/Tests"]` so the subfolder is picked up automatically):

- `DiffParserTests.swift` — fixture-driven. Fixtures under `apps/mac/touch-code/Tests/GitTests/Fixtures/`: `diff-added.txt`, `diff-deleted.txt`, `diff-modified.txt`, `diff-renamed.txt`, `diff-copied.txt`, `diff-binary.txt`, `diff-modechange.txt`, `diff-empty-newfile.txt`, `diff-no-newline-eof.txt`, `diff-merge-combined.txt`, `diff-crlf-mixed.txt`, `diff-too-large.txt` (50 001 lines). Assert the `UnifiedDiff` matches an embedded Swift literal expected value.
- `GitOutputParserTests.swift` — fixtures `log-linear.txt`, `log-merge.txt`, `log-root-only.txt`, `status-clean.txt`, `status-mixed.txt`, `status-utf8-paths.txt`. Assert parsed values.
- `GitProcessEnvTests.swift` — pass in a parent env with all forbidden keys set; assert output has only `PATH`, `HOME`, `LC_ALL`; assert a precondition failure when one leaks through (guarded by `#if DEBUG`).
- `LiveGitServiceIntegrationTests.swift` — gated behind `TC_RUN_GIT_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1` (skip via `try XCTSkipIf` reading `ProcessInfo.environment`). Creates a temp repo under `NSTemporaryDirectory()/touch-code-git-<UUID>/`, runs `git init`, writes files, commits them, and asserts `service.log` / `service.workingTreeDiff` / `service.commitDiff` return expected values. Cleans up via `FileManager.default.removeItem` in a `tearDown`.

**Observable acceptance.** `xcodebuild test -scheme touch-codeTests` includes the new parser-test cases and all pass. Integration tests pass locally under `TC_RUN_GIT_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1`. `make mac-lint` clean. A grep that guards the module's purity: `grep -rn 'import AppKit\|import SwiftUI\|import ComposableArchitecture\|import GhosttyKit' apps/mac/touch-code/Git` returns zero matches.

**Expected commits.** `feat(git): GitService protocol + LiveGitService over Process`, `feat(git): unified-diff + log parsers with fixtures`.

### Milestone 3: C7 TCA feature (reducer, no UI)

**Goal after this milestone.** A `GitViewerFeature` reducer exists in `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/GitViewer/`, a `GitServiceClient` `DependencyKey` sits next to the other clients added by `0002 M5`, and `TestStore`-driven tests prove scope transitions, pagination, request cancellation on scope change, error surfacing, and editor-open action delegation. No SwiftUI yet.

**Prerequisite.** `0002 M5` must have landed. That plan is the one that adds `swift-composable-architecture` to `apps/mac/Tuist/Package.swift` and introduces `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Clients/HierarchyClient.swift` + `TerminalClient.swift`. If M3 here is attempted before that, abandon and wait — do not add TCA ourselves, per the Decision Log discipline from `0002 DEC-3`.

**Work.**

Under `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Clients/`, create `GitServiceClient.swift`:

    import ComposableArchitecture
    import Foundation

    struct GitServiceClient: Sendable {
      var log: @Sendable (URL, LogPage.Cursor) async throws -> LogPage
      var workingTreeDiff: @Sendable (URL) async throws -> UnifiedDiff
      var stagedDiff: @Sendable (URL) async throws -> UnifiedDiff
      var commitDiff: @Sendable (URL, String) async throws -> UnifiedDiff
      var status: @Sendable (URL) async throws -> WorkingTreeStatus
    }
    extension GitServiceClient: DependencyKey {
      static let liveValue: GitServiceClient = …  // built from Git.makeService()
      static let testValue: GitServiceClient = …  // unimplemented() stubs, XCTFail on call
      static let previewValue: GitServiceClient = …  // canned fixtures
    }
    extension DependencyValues { var gitService: GitServiceClient { … } }

Under `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/GitViewer/`, create `GitViewerFeature.swift` implementing the reducer sketched in [c7-git-viewer.md §API Design](../design-docs/c7-git-viewer.md#api-design). Concrete contents:

- `@Reducer struct GitViewerFeature` with the exact `State` and `Action` from the design, plus two TCA cancellation IDs (`LogCancelID`, `DiffCancelID`) used to cancel stale effects when scope changes.
- `LogState = .idle | .loading | .loaded(LogPage) | .error(GitError)` and `DiffState = .idle | .loading | .loaded(UnifiedDiff) | .error(GitError)` nested enums.
- `PaneFocus = .list | .files | .hunks` and `Direction = .up | .down | .home | .end` nested enums.
- Body: scope changes cancel any in-flight request and issue the new one via `@Dependency(\.gitService)`. `.fileSelected` updates `selectedFilePath` (no git invocation). `.commitSelected(sha:)` transitions to `.commit(sha:)` scope after `GitShaValidator.isValid` passes. `.openInEditorRequested` delegates to `@Dependency(\.editorService)` **without blocking** the reducer — fire-and-forget effect, but the effect itself awaits the service call so errors surface via `.editorOpenResult(Result<EditorChoice, EditorError>)` (a new action added here for completeness; the service is introduced in M5 so M3 wires to a protocol + `@Dependency` placeholder that M5 fills).

To avoid a forward dependency on M5's `EditorService`, M3 defines a *minimal* placeholder `protocol EditorServiceFacade: Sendable { func openDirectory(_ url: URL, preferred: EditorID?, projectID: ProjectID?) async throws -> EditorChoiceDTO }` in `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Clients/EditorServiceFacade.swift`. The `testValue` implementation is `unimplemented()` (TCA's `XCTFail`-on-call); the `liveValue` **throws `EditorPlaceholderError.notYetImplemented`** (a one-case error added to `TouchCodeCore/Editor/` in M1) — never `fatalError`, never a UI-crasher. If a `.openInEditorRequested` action fires between M3 landing and M5 landing, the reducer receives a clean `Result.failure` and the UI renders it as a toast. M5 replaces the facade with the real `EditorClient` and the case becomes benign-unused (optional M6 clean-up). See [Decision Log §DEC-1](#decision-log) for why option (a) (placeholder error) was chosen over option (b) (live no-op returning a synthetic `EditorChoiceDTO`).

Tests under `apps/mac/touch-code/Tests/GitViewerTests/` (new subfolder):

- `GitViewerFeatureTests.swift` using `TestStore`:
  - `test_worktreeSelected_triggersStatusAndLog`: dispatch `.worktreeSelected(wt.id)`, assert effects request `status` and `log(offset: 0)`.
  - `test_scopeChange_cancelsPriorEffect`: dispatch `.scopeChanged(.working)` → `.scopeChanged(.staged)` quickly; assert the first effect is cancelled and only the staged response is observed.
  - `test_commitSelected_validatesSha`: dispatch with `"notahex"`; assert no effect fires and state stays in `.log`.
  - `test_paginationRequest`: dispatch `.logScrolledToBottom`, assert `.log(cursor: offset=100, limit=100)` fires.
  - `test_fileSelected_updatesWithoutGitCall`: dispatch `.fileSelected("README.md")`, assert no service call.
  - `test_openInEditorRequested_delegatesToFacade`: use a fake `EditorServiceFacade` that records the call; dispatch `.openInEditorRequested`; assert `openDirectory(worktreeURL, preferred: nil, projectID: projectID)` was invoked once.
  - `test_error_toasts`: inject a `GitError.exec(1, "fatal: not a git repository")`; assert state ends in `.diff(.error(...))`.
  - `test_worktreeReselected_clearsStaleState`: changing Worktree while a diff is loaded must reset state before issuing new effects.

**Observable acceptance.** `xcodebuild test -scheme touch-codeTests` adds the viewer tests and all pass. `make mac-build` still succeeds (the app compiles even though no view consumes the feature yet). No runtime user-visible change.

**Expected commits.** `feat(app): GitServiceClient dependency + EditorServiceFacade placeholder`, `feat(app): GitViewerFeature TCA reducer + TestStore coverage`.

### Milestone 4a: C7 SwiftUI viewer shell

**Goal after this milestone.** The user sees a working read-only viewer inside the running app. Selecting any Worktree in the sidebar populates the viewer; keyboard shortcuts navigate; a commit click renders its diff; the `Enter` key calls the M3 editor facade (which still throws `EditorPlaceholderError.notYetImplemented` until M5 replaces it with the real service — the error surfaces as a toast, not a crash). Large-diff handling is **not** in M4a — that moves to M4b alongside the snapshot harness.

**Work.**

Under `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/GitViewer/Views/` (new subfolder), create:

- `GitViewerView.swift` — root three-pane `SwiftUI.View`. Uses whatever state-binding idiom `0002 M5` establishes for its other features (typically `@Bindable var store: StoreOf<GitViewerFeature>`). Pane layout: left column 280 pt (list), center 300 pt (file list; only when scope is `.log` with a commit selected, otherwise hidden), right column flex (hunks). Scope switcher sits at the top as a segmented control bound to `.scope`.
- `CommitLogView.swift` — `List` over `state.log.page?.commits ?? []`. Each row is `Commit.shortID` (monospace, dimmed), `authorName`, `subject` (truncating tail), `date` (relative-time formatter). `.onAppear` of the last row dispatches `.logScrolledToBottom`.
- `FileChangeListView.swift` — `List` over `state.diff.unifiedDiff?.files ?? []`. Row is `[kindGlyph] [path]  +N −M`. Glyphs: `A`, `M`, `D`, `R→`, `C→`, `T`. Selection drives `.fileSelected(path:)`.
- `UnifiedDiffView.swift` — `ScrollView` with a single `LazyVStack(spacing: 0)` over the selected file's `hunks.flatMap(\.lines)`. Each line is an `HStack { oldLineNumber; newLineNumber; marker; Text(line.text).monospaced() }`. Marker is `+` / `-` / ` ` / `\` (no-newline). Colour via `Theme.git.{added,removed,context}` tokens (a new `Theme.git` namespace under `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Theme/ThemeGit.swift`).
- `GitViewerKeybindings.swift` — a `.focused` / `.onKeyPress` modifier chain wired to `Direction` actions: `j`/`k` → `.keyboardNavigation(.up/.down)`, `g` → `.home`, `G` → `.end`, `Tab` → `.paneFocusCycled`, `Enter` → `.commitSelected(shortID)` in log, `.openInEditorRequested` in files/hunks, `r` → `.refreshRequested`, `1`/`2`/`3` → `.scopeChanged(.working|.staged|.log)`, `.` → `.whitespaceToggled`, `/` → `.filterFocused`.

App-shell wiring (relies on the sidebar / tab bar from `0002 M5` already existing):

- Add a new pane slot to `RootFeature`'s state: `var gitViewer: GitViewerFeature.State = .init()`. A presentation modifier (right-pane inspector) hosts `GitViewerView`. Ship it as a toggle in the Worktree-header area (the same area M6 will add the "Open in" button to) so activation is explicit and the user sees the viewer on demand.
- `RootFeature` subscribes to `HierarchyManager` selection changes; on a new `selectedWorktreeID`, dispatch `.gitViewer(.worktreeSelected(…))`.

No snapshot tests in M4a. The reducer tests from M3 already cover state transitions; M4a's acceptance is visual and manual. Snapshot coverage lands in M4b once the harness is wired.

**Observable acceptance.** `make mac-build && make mac-run-app`. Add a Project pointing at this repo (using M5's sidebar from 0002), select a Worktree, hit the Git-viewer toggle on the header. See the commit log populate within ~500 ms on a warm cache. Type `j`/`k` to navigate; press `Enter` on a commit to see its diff. Press `r` to refresh. Type `3` to switch to log scope, `1` to working, `2` to staged. Pressing `Enter` on a file row before M5 lands shows an "editor not yet available" toast (the placeholder-error surface) — no crash. No mouse interaction is required to reach any state.

**Expected commits.** `feat(app): GitViewer SwiftUI views + keybindings`, `feat(app): viewer region + Worktree-header toggle`.

### Milestone 4b: Snapshot harness + large-diff placeholder + Copy-command

**Goal after this milestone.** The 50 000-line cutoff renders a `LargeDiffPlaceholderView` whose "Copy command" button puts an exact POSIX-quoted `cd '<abs-path>' && git …` string on the clipboard. A snapshot harness is wired to the test target, and the viewer's render states are locked by snapshot fixtures.

**Work.**

Add `pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing` to `apps/mac/Tuist/Package.swift` (see [DEC-2](#decision-log) for why this library). Pin the version to whichever the TCA dep pulls in transitively at install time; fall back to a float like `"1.17.0"` if TCA does not transitively depend on it.

Under `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/GitViewer/Views/`, create:

- `LargeDiffPlaceholderView.swift` — renders when `diffState == .error(GitError.diffTooLarge)`. Shows per-file summary rows (`[kind] [path]  +N −M`) and a "Copy command" button.

Under `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/GitViewer/` (alongside the reducer), create:

- `LargeDiffCommand.swift` — pure helper:

      enum LargeDiffCommand {
        static func build(scope: DiffScope, worktreePath: String, sha: String?) throws -> String
      }

  Throws `LargeDiffCommandError.logScopeUnsupported` for `.log` (the log scope paginates; it never hits the cutoff). POSIX-quotes `worktreePath` (wrap in `'…'`; replace internal `'` with `'\''`) and returns the exact strings from [c7-git-viewer.md §Rendering](../design-docs/c7-git-viewer.md#rendering).

Tests:

- `LargeDiffCommandTests.swift` — fixture table (pure helper; no UI):
  | Worktree path | Scope | Expected |
  |---|---|---|
  | `/Users/gump/x` | `.working` | `cd '/Users/gump/x' && git diff --no-color` |
  | `/tmp/with space` | `.staged` | `cd '/tmp/with space' && git diff --no-color --cached` |
  | `/a/b's/c` | `.commit(sha:"deadbee")` | `cd '/a/b'\''s/c' && git show --no-color deadbee` |
  | `/x` | `.log` | (helper throws `LargeDiffCommandError.logScopeUnsupported`) |

- `GitViewerSnapshotTests.swift` under `apps/mac/touch-code/Tests/GitViewerTests/Snapshots/` — four happy-path snapshots (log populated, working diff with 10 files, commit diff with rename+binary+added, `.notARepo` empty state) plus two error-path snapshots (`.diffTooLarge` placeholder with a path containing a space, `.exec` error toast). Stored reference images live under the same folder with the default `.png` suffix the library produces.

**Observable acceptance.** `pbpaste` after pressing "Copy command" on a synthetic 60 000-line diff (generated by `yes 'x' | head -n 60001 > bigfile && git add bigfile && git commit -m big`) returns exactly the string the table above predicts for the current worktree path. Snapshot tests pass on the CI runner. `make mac-lint` clean.

**Expected commits.** `feat(app): large-diff placeholder + POSIX-quoted Copy command`, `test(app): GitViewer snapshot fixtures + harness`.

### Milestone 5: C8 editor service layer

**Goal after this milestone.** `touch-code/App/Clients/Editor/` exists with a complete `EditorService`, its live implementation, the six-entry allowlist, a pure `PathProber`, and a `ProcessSpawner` that isolates `Foundation.Process` for testability. Every path — resolution, spawn, error — is unit-tested without invoking a real editor, plus a single integration test invokes `/usr/bin/open`.

This milestone is symmetric to M2 but for C8: it ends with a service ready to drive, and it does not touch the UI.

**Work.**

Under `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Clients/Editor/`, create the files named in [c8-editor-integration.md §Component Boundaries](../design-docs/c8-editor-integration.md#component-boundaries):

- `EditorService.swift` — the protocol. Three async methods (`describe`, `resolve`, `open`).
- `EditorService+Live.swift` — `LiveEditorService` (struct holding a `ProcessSpawner`, a `PathProber`, and closures that read the global default + custom editors from `SettingsStore` and the per-Project override from `HierarchyManager`). `resolve` implements the four-tier fallback chain from the design with **no silent fallthrough**. `open` runs the resolved template through `ProcessSpawner`.

  Closure shape and lifetime: every read-closure is typed `@Sendable () -> T?` (not an escaping method reference), and the captures reference `SettingsStore` / `HierarchyManager` via `weak` to avoid a retain cycle that would outlive app-shutdown teardown. Concretely:

        init(
          spawner: ProcessSpawner,
          prober: PathProber,
          globalDefault: @Sendable @escaping () -> EditorID?,
          customEditors: @Sendable @escaping () -> [CustomEditor],
          projectOverride: @Sendable @escaping (ProjectID) -> EditorID?
        )

  The live factory in `EditorClient.liveValue` builds the closures with `{ [weak settings] in settings?.defaultEditorID }` and `{ [weak hierarchy] projectID in hierarchy?.catalog.project(id: projectID)?.defaultEditor }`. Returning `nil` on a collected store is correct: the fallback chain moves to the next tier.
- `EditorService+Test.swift` — in-memory implementation records every `open` call into an array; `describe` returns a caller-supplied array.
- `EditorRegistry.swift` — the six `EditorDescriptor` entries exactly as in [c8-editor-integration.md §Built-in allowlist](../design-docs/c8-editor-integration.md#built-in-allowlist-hard-coded-versioned-with-the-app). A `merged(with customs: [CustomEditor]) -> [EditorDescriptor]` helper that rejects ID collisions with a thrown error.
- `EditorModels.swift` — `EditorDescriptor`, `EditorChoice`, `InstallationStatus`, `EditorDescriptor.Origin`. These are **App-tier** types; the IPC-crossing DTOs in M1 are distinct so the live EditorService can carry richer state (e.g., an `@Observable` installation cache) without that state leaking to the wire. Bridging helpers `EditorDescriptor.toDTO() -> EditorDescriptorDTO` and symmetric `EditorChoice.toDTO()` are added here for M7.
- `EditorError.swift` — `public enum EditorError: Error, Equatable { case notInstalled(id: EditorID, binary: String); case spawnFailed(reason: String); case nonZeroExit(code: Int32, stderr: String); case timedOut; case badTemplate(id: EditorID, reason: String); case notADirectory(path: String); case unresolvedWorktree }`. Every case directly from the design's error table.
- `ProcessSpawner.swift` — the protocol:

      protocol ProcessSpawner: Sendable {
        func spawnForOpen(
          argv: [String],
          env: [String: String],
          cwd: URL,
          timeout: Duration
        ) async -> ProcessOutcome
      }

      enum ProcessOutcome: Equatable {
        case exited(code: Int32, stderr: String)
        case timedOut  // child was still alive at timeout; spawner sent SIGTERM then SIGKILL
        case spawnFailed(reason: String)
      }

  Two implementations: `FoundationProcessSpawner` (default, uses `Foundation.Process` with `Process.terminate()` + a 1 s polling wait before `kill(-9)`) and `RecordingProcessSpawner` (test double that records `(argv, env, cwd)` and returns a caller-canned `ProcessOutcome`).
- `PathProber.swift` — `protocol PathProber: Sendable { func locate(binaryName: String) -> URL? }`. `LivePathProber` consults `$PATH` by `realpath`-stat-ing `${dir}/${binaryName}` for each `:`-separated `$PATH` entry; returns the first readable/executable match. Caches results in a `@MainActor`-confined dictionary. Refresh triggers: `refresh()` is called (a) when `SettingsEditorSection` becomes visible (M6), (b) when a custom editor is added/removed (M6), (c) on `editor.describe` IPC (M7).
- `EditorEnv.swift` — `enum EditorEnv { static let whitelist: [String] = ["PATH", "HOME"]; static let forced: [String: String] = ["LC_ALL": "C.UTF-8"]; static let forbidden: Set<String> = ["SHELL", "EDITOR", "VISUAL", "GIT_DIR", "GIT_CONFIG", "GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM", "GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL", "GIT_ASKPASS", "JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS"]; static func build(from parent: [String: String]) -> [String: String] }`. Symmetric to `GitProcessEnv` (M2); keeps the env-stripping discipline visible side-by-side so a reviewer can see both are aligned (per C8 review feedback — `SHELL` is stripped here; this was fixed in the design's round-2 review).
- `SpawnContract.swift` — `enum SpawnContract { static let timeout: Duration = .seconds(5); static let sigtermGrace: Duration = .seconds(1) }`. One source of truth for both numbers.

Tests under `apps/mac/touch-code/Tests/EditorTests/` (new subfolder):

- `EditorRegistryTests.swift` — assert the six built-in descriptors match the design's table byte-for-byte (IDs, display names, argv templates). Assert `merged(with:)` rejects `CustomEditor(id: "vscode", …)` with `.invalidID("vscode")` error surfaced as `EditorError.badTemplate`.
- `EditorValidatorsTests.swift` — already covered in M1; no duplication here.
- `PathProberTests.swift` — protocol-based FakeFileSystem that returns predetermined listings; assert `LivePathProber` picks the first PATH entry, skips non-executable, returns nil on not-found.
- `EditorServiceResolutionTests.swift` — TCA-free, driven by `LiveEditorService` with a `RecordingProcessSpawner`. Cases:
  1. `preferred = "vscode"` with vscode installed → resolves to vscode.
  2. `preferred = nil`, `project.defaultEditor = "cursor"`, cursor installed → cursor.
  3. `preferred = nil`, project override nil, `settings.defaultEditorID = "zed"`, zed installed → zed.
  4. `preferred = nil`, all nil → finder.
  5. `preferred = "vscode"`, vscode **not** installed → throws `.notInstalled`; **no silent fallthrough** to a next tier.
- `EditorServiceSpawnTests.swift` — `RecordingProcessSpawner`-driven:
  - argv matches the template for each built-in ID (six cases).
  - `{dir}` substitution is literal; a path with spaces reaches argv as a single argument, unquoted (no shell).
  - `env` has exactly `{"PATH", "HOME", "LC_ALL"}` for each spawn.
  - `cwd` is the absolute worktree URL.
  - `.exited(code: 0)` → success return.
  - `.exited(code: 1, stderr: "bad")` → `EditorError.nonZeroExit(1, "bad")`.
  - `.timedOut` → `EditorError.timedOut`.
  - `.spawnFailed(reason: "ENOENT")` → `EditorError.spawnFailed(reason: "ENOENT")`.
- `LiveProcessSpawnerIntegrationTests.swift` — gated by `TC_RUN_EDITOR_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1`. Spawns `/usr/bin/open` with argv `["open", NSTemporaryDirectory()]` and asserts `ProcessOutcome.exited(code: 0, …)`.

**Observable acceptance.** `xcodebuild test -scheme touch-codeTests` runs the editor tests; all pass. Under `TC_RUN_EDITOR_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1`, the live-spawn smoke test launches Finder on the tmp directory and passes. `make mac-lint` clean. No UI change yet.

**Expected commits.** `feat(editor): EditorService + allowlist + ProcessSpawner`, `feat(editor): PathProber + env whitelist + spawn contract`.

### Milestone 6: C8 TCA feature + Settings section + Worktree-header button

**Goal after this milestone.** The user sees an "Open in ▾" dropdown on the Worktree header, clicks it, and the current Worktree opens in the chosen editor. The Settings window has an "Editors" section with the six built-in entries (each marked installed / missing), a custom-editor list with add/edit/remove, and a global-default picker. Per-Project overrides persist in `catalog.json` (via `HierarchyClient`), custom editors + global default persist in `settings.json` (via a new `SettingsStore`).

**Work.**

Under `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Clients/`:

- `EditorClient.swift` — parallel to `GitServiceClient`. `DependencyKey`-conforming struct with `describe`, `resolve`, `open` closures. `liveValue` is built from `LiveEditorService` plus the project/settings lookup closures.
- Replace the M3 placeholder `EditorServiceFacade` with a real one backed by `EditorClient.open`. Delete `EditorServiceFacade.swift` and update `GitViewerFeature` to `@Dependency(\.editorClient)` directly.

Under `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/Editor/`:

- `EditorFeature.swift` — a small TCA reducer that owns the "describe + resolve" state for the dropdown and Settings section. `State` carries `available: [EditorDescriptor]`, `globalDefault: EditorID?`, `customEditors: [CustomEditor]`. Actions: `.onAppear`, `.describeResponse(...)`, `.setGlobalDefault(EditorID?)`, `.addCustomEditor(CustomEditor)`, `.updateCustomEditor(id: EditorID, CustomEditor)`, `.removeCustomEditor(EditorID)`. The reducer persists changes through `SettingsStore`.

Under `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/Settings/`:

- `SettingsStore.swift` — `@MainActor @Observable` class managing `~/.config/touch-code/settings.json` via `AtomicFileStore`. Stores `{ version: 1, defaultEditorID: String?, customEditors: [CustomEditor] }`. Debounces writes with the same 500 ms pattern as `CatalogStore` (0002 M2). Decode failure backs up to `settings.json.broken-<ISO8601>`.
- `SettingsEditorSection.swift` — SwiftUI form. A `Picker` bound to the global default. A `List` of custom editors with a sheet-based editor supporting inline validation against `CommandTemplate.validate` and `CustomEditor.validatedID`. A "Refresh editor detection" button that calls `editorClient.describe` and re-renders installed/missing markers.
- `SettingsFeature.swift` (if this does not already exist from 0002 M5, create minimally; otherwise add the editor section as a child).

Under `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/WorktreeHeader/` (new feature folder; documented in design as "not yet in architecture.md" per the C8 review fix):

- `WorktreeHeaderOpenButton.swift` — A `Menu` view that renders `editorFeature.state.available` as rows (disabled rows for `.missingBinary`), plus a "Custom…" sub-menu surfacing `customEditors`, plus a "Set as default…" action. Clicking a row dispatches `.openInEditor(id)` which resolves to `editorClient.open(directory: worktree.path, preferred: id, projectID: project.id)`. The dropdown's current label is the resolved editor's `displayName` for the active Worktree (obtained via `editorClient.resolve`).

Per-Project override writes:

- Add `HierarchyClient.setDefaultEditor(projectID: ProjectID, editorID: EditorID?)` to the command enum. `liveValue` dispatches to `HierarchyManager.setDefaultEditor(_:for:)` which mutates `Project.defaultEditor` and triggers a debounced save.

Wiring:

- `RootFeature` gains `var editor: EditorFeature.State` and `var settings: SettingsFeature.State`. `.onAppear` dispatches `.editor(.onAppear)` so `describe` runs once on launch.
- `GitViewerFeature.openInEditorRequested` now resolves through the real `editorClient.open`; the test suite's fake from M3 is replaced by the `EditorClient.testValue` canned from M5's `EditorService+Test`.

Tests:

- `EditorFeatureTests.swift` — TCA `TestStore`. Cover: `.onAppear` issues `describe`; `.setGlobalDefault("vscode")` calls `settingsStore.setDefaultEditorID` and bounces back through state; `.addCustomEditor` with invalid template surfaces a validation error without mutating state; `.removeCustomEditor` writes through.
- `SettingsStoreTests.swift` — round-trip writes and reads under a tmp HOME; corrupt file → backup + default.
- `WorktreeHeaderOpenButtonTests.swift` — `TestStore` with a recording `EditorClient.testValue` asserting `.openInEditor("cursor")` produces an `open(.cursor, project: …)` call.
- One snapshot test of the dropdown with three built-ins installed + two missing + one custom.

**Observable acceptance.** Launch the app, select a Worktree, click "Open in ▾". See the six built-ins; missing ones are disabled with the design's explicit label ("CLI `code` not found on PATH"). Pick Finder → Finder opens `<worktree-path>`. Pick Cursor (if installed) → Cursor opens the directory. In Settings → Editors, set global default to Zed; click outside Settings; relaunch; confirm persistence. Add a custom editor "helix" with template `("hx", ["{dir}"])`; assert it appears in the dropdown if `hx` is on `PATH`. Right-click a Worktree in the sidebar → "Set default editor for this Project" → VSCode; assert `catalog.json` now contains `"defaultEditor": "vscode"` under that Project.

**Expected commits.** `feat(editor): EditorClient TCA bridge + EditorFeature`, `feat(settings): SettingsStore + editors section`, `feat(app): Worktree-header Open-in dropdown`, `feat(runtime): setDefaultEditor through HierarchyClient`.

### Milestone 7a: `editor.*` IPC wire types + `tc open` subcommand

**Goal after this milestone.** `tc open [--in <editor>] [<worktree>]` parses correctly, the Worktree-resolution order is exercised in tests, and every envelope crosses the wire correctly against a **fake** IPC client. No real socket is exercised here; M7b wires the app side. Landing M7a independently is safe because nothing beyond the CLI target and the IPC wire types changes.

**Work.**

Under `apps/mac/TouchCodeIPC/Editor/`, expand `EditorIPCTypes.swift` (created in M1) with request/response envelopes:

    public struct EditorOpenRequest: Codable, Equatable, Sendable {
      public var worktreeID: UUID?           // nil means: resolve via TOUCH_CODE_PANEL_ID
      public var preferred: EditorID?
      public var panelID: UUID?              // app uses this to resolve worktreeID when above is nil
    }
    public struct EditorOpenResponse: Codable, Equatable, Sendable {
      public var choice: EditorChoiceDTO
    }
    public struct EditorDescribeResponse: Codable, Equatable, Sendable {
      public var descriptors: [EditorDescriptorDTO]
    }
    public struct EditorSetDefaultRequest: Codable, Equatable, Sendable {
      public var projectID: UUID
      public var editorID: EditorID?         // nil unsets the override
    }

Add `EditorIPCError.swift` — wraps the app's `EditorError` into wire-safe codes: `.unresolvedWorktree = 100`, `.notInstalled = 101`, `.nonZeroExit = 102`, `.timedOut = 103`, `.spawnFailed = 104`, `.badTemplate = 105`, `.notADirectory = 106`. The JSON-RPC `{ error: { code, message } }` envelope re-uses this code table.

Under `apps/mac/tc/Commands/` (new subfolder — update `tc` target's `buildableFolders` accordingly), create `OpenCommand.swift`:

    struct OpenCommand: ParsableCommand {
      static let configuration = CommandConfiguration(
        commandName: "open",
        abstract: "Open the current Worktree directory in an external editor."
      )
      @Option(name: .customLong("in"))  var editorID: String?
      @Argument(help: "Worktree name or UUID; optional inside a Panel.")
      var worktree: String?
      func run() throws { /* … */ }
    }

`run()` resolves the Worktree ID in order: (1) explicit `--worktree`/positional; (2) `ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["TOUCH_CODE_PANEL_ID"]` passed via the IPC envelope's `panelID` field; (3) neither → print `"error: no worktree (pass <worktree> or run from inside a touch-code Panel)"` to stderr and `throw ExitCode(2)`. For (1) and (2), it issues `editor.open` via a lightweight `IPCClient` helper under `apps/mac/tc/IPCClient.swift`.

Also under `apps/mac/tc/`, add `IPCClient.swift` — a thin helper that encodes requests to JSON and decodes responses. Protocol-based so tests inject a `RecordingIPCClient`:

    protocol IPCClient: Sendable {
      func call<Request: Encodable, Response: Decodable>(
        method: String, request: Request, response: Response.Type
      ) async throws -> Response
    }

Update `apps/mac/tc/main.swift` to include `OpenCommand.self` in its subcommands array.

Tests (host the tests under `touch-codeTests` — see DEC-3 note about declining to add a `tcTests` target in this plan):

- `OpenCommandParseTests.swift` — `ArgumentParser` tests:
  - `tc open --in vscode main-worktree` → `(editorID: "vscode", worktree: "main-worktree")`.
  - `tc open` with no args → `(editorID: nil, worktree: nil)`.
  - `tc open --in xcode` → `(editorID: "xcode", worktree: nil)`.
- `OpenCommandResolutionTests.swift` — drive with a `RecordingIPCClient` fake and a synthetic env:
  - With `TOUCH_CODE_PANEL_ID = <uuid>` set → asserts the call payload is `EditorOpenRequest(worktreeID: nil, preferred: "vscode", panelID: <uuid>)`.
  - With no env and no positional → asserts stderr contains `"no worktree"`, exit code 2, **zero** IPC calls on the recorder.
  - With explicit positional `main-worktree` → asserts the call payload resolves through the name. (Names are resolved server-side in M7b; the CLI passes the positional through as a `hierarchy.resolveWorktree` pre-call, or as a `worktreeID?` + a separate name field — leave this as a minor design choice for M7b.)

**Observable acceptance.** `make mac-build-cli`. From a regular terminal:

    tc open
    # stderr: "error: no worktree (pass <worktree> or run from inside a touch-code Panel)"
    # exit code: 2
    echo $?
    # 2

    tc open --help
    # stdout: usage message with --in option and worktree argument

Unit tests pass under `xcodebuild test -scheme touch-codeTests`. `make mac-lint` clean.

**Expected commits.** `feat(ipc): editor.* wire types + error codes`, `feat(tc): open subcommand + IPCClient helper`.

### Milestone 7b: `SocketServer` dispatch of `editor.*`

**Goal after this milestone.** `tc open` from inside a Panel actually opens the editor end-to-end. Method dispatch lives in the `SocketServer`; the `editor.*` handlers bridge to `EditorClient` and `HierarchyClient`.

**Prerequisite.** Per [DEC-3](#decision-log), the plan of record is that `SocketServer` is delivered by `docs/exec-plans/0003-hooks-and-cli.md` (the in-flight C3+C4 plan). Before starting M7b, check whether `0003` has landed a `SocketServer` with a method-dispatch hook. If yes, M7b only adds `editor.*` handlers under an existing dispatch map. If no, M7b lands a narrow editor-only dispatcher under `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/Socket/` with just enough socket-accept + JSON-RPC framing to drive the three `editor.*` methods, and Decision Log records the fallback (so `0003` generalises instead of reimplementing).

**Work (when `0003` SocketServer is present).**

Under `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/Socket/`, extend the existing dispatch map with three handlers:

- `editor.describe` → call `editorClient.describe()` → wrap in `EditorDescribeResponse`.
- `editor.open` → if `request.worktreeID == nil`, resolve via `request.panelID → HierarchyManager.panel(byID: …).parentWorktreeID`; if still nil, return `EditorIPCError.unresolvedWorktree` (code 100). Otherwise resolve the `Worktree.path`, call `editorClient.open(directory:preferred:projectID:)`, wrap in `EditorOpenResponse`.
- `editor.setDefault` → call `HierarchyClient.setDefaultEditor`.

**Work (fallback, when `0003` has not landed).**

Under `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/Socket/`, add:

- `SocketServer.swift` — minimal `@MainActor` class that listens on `TOUCH_CODE_SOCKET_PATH ?? "/tmp/touch-code-$UID.sock"` using `SwiftNIO`'s `ServerBootstrap` (or a `dispatch_io`-based hand-rolled server if adding SwiftNIO is contentious — prefer the SwiftNIO path, it's how supaterm does it; record as a decision). Accepts connections; frames length-prefixed JSON per the architecture doc; dispatches to a method map that contains only the three `editor.*` entries. All non-editor methods return `-32601 Method not found`.
- `SocketServerLifecycle.swift` — starts the server at app launch; stops cleanly on `applicationWillTerminate`.
- **Explicitly note in Decision Log** that this is a narrow editor-only dispatcher, so `0003` replaces rather than extends it.

Tests:

- `SocketServerEditorDispatchTests.swift` — synthetic JSON-RPC envelope in, parsed response out. Cover: `editor.describe` returns the registry; `editor.open` with missing IDs surfaces code 100; `editor.open` with a valid worktree ID invokes the recording `EditorClient.testValue` with the expected args.
- `TcOpenE2ETests.swift` (gated behind `TC_RUN_IPC_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1`) — spin up a real `SocketServer` on a temp socket path; spawn `tc open` as a subprocess with `TOUCH_CODE_SOCKET_PATH` overridden; assert stdout `"opened <name> in Finder"` and exit 0.

**Observable acceptance.** Build `tc` and the app via `make mac-build`. Launch the app, open a Panel, then inside it:

    tc open
    # stdout: "opened <Worktree name> in <Editor display>"
    # exit code 0

    tc open --in zed
    # opens Zed on the current Worktree directory

    tc open some-other-worktree --in finder
    # opens Finder on the named Worktree

**Expected commits.** `feat(ipc): editor.* method handlers`, `feat(app): SocketServer editor dispatch (+ fallback scaffold if 0003 hasn't landed)`, `test(ipc): end-to-end tc open smoke`.

### Milestone 8: Cross-feature integration + performance + docs close-out

**Goal after this milestone.** A contributor can run the nine-step acceptance walkthrough end-to-end with every step green; performance assertions hold; the architecture codemap and the product spec's Open Question #7 are updated to reflect the shipped design.

**Work.**

Tests:

- `apps/mac/touch-code/Tests/Integration/GitViewerEditorIntegrationTests.swift` — `TestStore` spanning `RootFeature` with real `GitViewerFeature`, real `EditorFeature`, real `HierarchyManager`, and a `RecordingProcessSpawner` + mock `GitService`. Scenario: launch → select Worktree → scope `.log` → pick commit → press `Enter` → assert the editor dispatcher is called with the resolved editor ID and the Worktree path.
- `apps/mac/touch-code/Tests/Performance/GitViewerPerformanceTests.swift` — measures parse + reducer-state-update wall-clock via `ContinuousClock.Instant` against a checked-in synthetic 1 000-line `git diff` fixture (`Tests/Performance/fixtures/diff-1000-lines.txt`). Gated by `TC_RUN_PERFORMANCE_TESTS=1`.

  **Baseline collection (one-shot per machine; CI runners capture their own):**
  - Take **50 samples**, discard the **first 5** as warm-up (cold caches skew P95).
  - Record median, P95, and max per metric (`parse_ms`, `reducer_ms`) to `Tests/Performance/baseline.json`. The file is **per-machine**, gitignored — each contributor regenerates their local baseline on first run; CI has its own.
  - Running in baseline-capture mode (`TC_PERF_BASELINE=capture`) overwrites the file; default mode asserts against it.

  **Assertion ceiling (default mode):**

      assertion_ceiling = max(designBudget, baseline.p95 × driftMargin)

      where driftMargin = 1.25
            designBudget.parse_ms = 80   (20 % of the 200 ms whole-pipeline budget)
            designBudget.reducer_ms = 20 (5  % of the pipeline budget)

  The test fails when the current run's P95 exceeds the ceiling. If a baseline on an M1 is already above the design budget, the ceiling defers to the baseline — that's a signal recorded in Surprises & Discoveries so the spec (not the test) is re-evaluated, rather than a passing test that lies about the NFR.

  **Why 50 samples + warm-up discard + P95**: 10 samples are insufficient for a stable P95; Swift's ARC, cache warmth, and macOS scheduler all introduce variance. 5 warm-up samples drop the cold-cache outliers without lengthening CI. P95 (not max) absorbs a single adversarial schedule without masking real regressions.

  **Why clock = `ContinuousClock.Instant`**: monotonic, nanosecond-resolution, immune to wall-clock changes during the run. `os_signpost` captures the same data but its summary-mode output is not addressable from test assertions — we emit both (signposts for Instruments correlation, clock for assertions).
- `apps/mac/touch-code/Tests/Integration/EditorFallbackChainTests.swift` — end-to-end exercises the fallback chain: (a) per-project override set + editor installed → opens the override; (b) per-project override set + editor missing → surfaces `.notInstalled` without falling through to global; (c) no override, global set, installed → opens global; (d) nothing set → opens Finder.
- `apps/mac/touch-code/Tests/Integration/IPCEditorTests.swift` — spins up a real `SocketServer` on a temp socket path, runs `tc open` as a subprocess against it with a `TOUCH_CODE_SOCKET_PATH` override, asserts the response envelope round-trip.

Documentation close-out:

- `docs/architecture.md` — add `touch-code/Git/` and `touch-code/App/Clients/Editor/` to the in-app module table; add `touch-code/App/Features/WorktreeHeader/` to the features list (per C8 review note).
- `docs/product-spec.md` — update Open Question #7 entry to `(Resolved by docs/design-docs/c8-editor-integration.md.)`; mark C7 and C8 as `Beta` in the capability maturity column once the acceptance walkthrough passes.
- `docs/design-docs/README.md` — no change (already updated).
- `docs/exec-plans/README.md` — confirm 0005 is listed with a one-line description.

Dogfooding acceptance walkthrough (to be appended to `Outcomes & Retrospective` once run):

1. `make mac-generate && make mac-build && make mac-run-app`.
2. Add the touch-code repo as a Project; select the current branch's Worktree.
3. Toggle the Git viewer. See the last 100 commits in < 500 ms on a warm cache.
4. Press `1` → working-tree diff; `2` → staged; `3` → log; `Enter` on a commit → its diff. All transitions under one frame.
5. Press `Enter` on a file row → Worktree opens in the default editor (Finder on a fresh install).
6. Open Settings → Editors → pick Zed as global default (if installed) → confirm `settings.json` updates.
7. Right-click the Project → "Set default editor" → Cursor → confirm `catalog.json` updates.
8. Click the Worktree-header "Open in ▾" → Cursor → Cursor opens the directory.
9. From a Panel: `tc open` → editor opens; `tc open --in finder` → Finder opens; `exit` the panel, run `tc open` from a regular shell → exit 2 with the documented stderr line.

**Observable acceptance.** All tests pass (including the gated performance + integration ones). Every step above is green. Architecture and product-spec changes land in a single commit alongside the test additions.

**Expected commits.** `test(integration): cross-feature GitViewer + Editor paths`, `test(perf): 1000-line diff parse + dispatch budgets`, `docs: update architecture codemap and close product-spec OQ7`.

    # 4. Run the dogfooding walkthrough from the Milestone 8 section above.

## Validation and Acceptance

After all eight milestones land, a fresh contributor can observe:

1. `make mac-bootstrap && make mac-generate && make mac-build && make mac-run-app` — app launches in < 1 s.
2. Select a Git-backed Worktree. Toggle the Git viewer. Log populates in < 500 ms on a warm cache.
3. `j`/`k` navigate the log; `Enter` opens a commit's diff; `1`/`2`/`3` switch scope; `r` refreshes; `.` toggles whitespace-ignore; `/` filters file names; all under one frame.
4. A 1 000-line diff parses and renders in under 200 ms (measured by the performance test).
5. A synthetic 60 000-line diff shows the placeholder with a "Copy command" button whose output is the expected `cd '<abs-path>' && git …` (with POSIX-quoted paths for paths containing spaces or apostrophes).
6. Clicking "Open in ▾" on the Worktree header lists the six built-ins with accurate installed/missing state, plus any configured custom editors.
7. Choosing an installed editor opens the Worktree **directory** in that editor within 5 s; choosing a missing built-in shows the exact design-mandated error ("Visual Studio Code CLI (`code`) not found on PATH. Install via 'Shell Command: Install code command in PATH' in VSCode's Command Palette.").
8. From inside a Panel, `tc open` opens the default editor; `tc open --in zed` opens Zed; `tc open some-other-worktree` targets a named Worktree. From a regular shell, `tc open` exits 2 with the exact stderr line.
9. Settings → Editors shows the registry, allows adding a custom editor with validation, and persists through relaunch.
10. `xcodebuild test -scheme TouchCodeCoreTests` and `-scheme touch-codeTests` all green. `make mac-lint` clean.

Failure on any of the above blocks sign-off.

## Idempotence and Recovery

Every milestone is re-runnable.

- **Regenerate workspace.** `make mac-generate` is idempotent; safe after any `Project.swift` edit.
- **Reset settings.** `mv ~/.config/touch-code/settings.json ~/.config/touch-code/settings.json.bak` forces default settings on next launch. A corrupt file is automatically backed up to `settings.json.broken-<timestamp>`.
- **Reset the viewer's in-flight work.** The viewer is stateless across launches; no reset needed. If a `git` subprocess hangs (should be caught by the 10 s timeout), `pkill -f '^git ' -n` kills the most recent child.
- **Reset the path-probe cache.** No on-disk state; the cache is process-local. Relaunch the app or open Settings → Editors → "Refresh editor detection".
- **Recover from a custom-editor template that breaks the dropdown.** Edit `~/.config/touch-code/settings.json` manually to remove the offending `customEditors` entry; relaunch.
- **Unwind a failed `tc open`.** No rollback needed; the command is spawn-only and never mutates state.
- **Recover from an accidentally-committed `GIT_*` env leak.** The `GitProcessEnv.build` assertions fail-fast in debug; any leak is surfaced immediately during testing.

None of the steps modify global state (no `xcode-select`, no PATH mutation, no `launchctl` entries).

## Artifacts and Notes

No prototyping was required beyond what the design docs already establish:

- **Unified-diff parser.** `git diff`'s output shape is stable and well-documented; the parser is a routine state machine over `diff --git`, `index`, `---`, `+++`, `@@`, and per-hunk lines. The design's fixture list (M2 test plan) covers every branch the parser handles.
- **Launch Services vs. CLI wrappers.** Decided in design round 1; confirmed in round 2. `NSWorkspace.open` is used exclusively for Xcode (no CLI) via the `open -a Xcode {dir}` wrapper.
- **Spawn contract.** Round-2 review simplified the contract to a single rule (exit-code or timeout); no "assume detached" heuristic.

When work begins, log in Decision Log any adjustment to these assumptions. Planned transcripts (e.g. `pbpaste` output confirming the Copy-command string) will be captured here as each milestone completes.

## Interfaces and Dependencies

The following types, functions, and signatures must exist by plan completion. Names are binding — later plans reference them.

**`TouchCodeCore/Git/`** (pure Swift; zero platform imports):

**External dependencies added by this plan**: `pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing` (pinned in M4b; see [DEC-2](#decision-log)). `swift-composable-architecture` is assumed already present via `0002 M5`.

**Tuist targets added by this plan**: none. All tests land under the existing `TouchCodeCoreTests` and `touch-codeTests` targets, whose `buildableFolders` pick up new subfolders automatically. A dedicated `tcTests` target is deliberately declined in M7a; if later needed, it becomes a Decision Log entry at implementation time.

**Prerequisite ordering.**

- **M1** and **M2** can begin before `0002` completes because they do not touch the app target.
- **M3** through **M6** require `0002 M5` (TCA wired, sidebar and clients landed).
- **M7a** only depends on M5 and M6 (IPC wire types + CLI; no socket-server yet) — safe to land as soon as M6 is green.
- **M7b** depends on `SocketServer` from the in-flight `docs/exec-plans/0003-hooks-and-cli.md` (C3+C4). If `0003` has not landed by M7b-time, M7b lands a narrow editor-only dispatcher and records the fallback in Decision Log so `0003` generalises rather than reimplements. See [DEC-3](#decision-log).
- **M8** depends on every milestone above being green.
