# ExecPlan: Unified Keyboard Shortcut Management

**Status:** In Progress
**Author:** Gump
**Date:** 2026-04-28

This is a living document. The Progress, Surprises & Discoveries, Decision Log, and Outcomes & Retrospective sections must be kept up to date as work proceeds.

## Purpose

After this change, a touch-code user opens **Settings → Shortcuts** and sees every in-app keyboard shortcut listed by category — Quick Action, Tabs, Sidebar Worktrees, plus the read-only system row for `⌘,`. They can click any chord cell, press a new key combination, and have the change take effect immediately: the menu item updates, the new chord fires the action, and the previous chord no longer does. They can disable a shortcut without losing their previous binding, reset one row to its default (with the app explaining when a reset will cascade because of a swap-conflict), or reset everything at once. A user on a non-US-QWERTY keyboard sees keycaps that match what is physically printed on their keys, even after switching input source mid-session. On disk, only differences from the defaults are kept — `~/.config/touch-code/shortcuts.json` is empty for a fresh user and human-readable for power users. Internally, every existing hardcoded shortcut (`MainWindowCommands` thirteen entries plus the nine `⌃⌘1..9` sidebar hotkeys) routes through the same registry, so adding a new shortcut later is a one-line schema entry rather than another sprinkled `.keyboardShortcut(…)` call.

## Progress

- [ ] M1 — TouchCodeCore: `CommandID` enum, `ShortcutBinding`, `ModifierMask`, `ShortcutScope`, `ShortcutSchema` with defaults table; schema audit unit test pinning today's literals
- [ ] M2 — TouchCodeCore: `ShortcutOverrideStore`, `ShortcutResolver`, `ShortcutResetPlanner`, three `ConflictDetectors`; unit coverage for each (parallelizable across sub-agents once M1 lands)
- [ ] M3 — App: `ShortcutsStore` (`@MainActor @Observable`, `AtomicFileStore`, 500 ms debounce, broken-file backup); store unit tests
- [ ] M4 — App: `ShortcutDisplay` (UCKeyTranslate keycap + KeyEquivalent conversion + input-source-change observer); display unit tests under fixed layout fixture
- [ ] M5 — App: `ShortcutEnvironment` + `View+appKeyboardShortcut` modifier (two forms — `Commands`-friendly explicit-map and view-friendly env-driven)
- [ ] M6 — App wiring: instantiate `ShortcutsStore` in `TouchCodeApp`, inject environment, rewrite `MainWindowCommands` thirteen bindings to read from registry, migrate `StatusMotivationalView` and `CommandPaletteItems` palette-hint consumers, delete `CommandPaletteShortcut.swift`
- [ ] M7 — `HierarchySidebarView` row-hotkey rewrite: nine `⌃⌘1..9` invisible buttons read from registry; delete `hotkeyModifiers` constant
- [ ] M8 — `HotkeyRecorderNSView` + SwiftUI wrapper; conflict feedback (system/AppKit reject + internal-conflict popover)
- [ ] M9 — `ShortcutsSettingsView` replacing `ComingSoonPane(title: "Shortcuts")`; search, category groups, recorder cell, disable, per-row reset with cascade dialog, restore-all
- [ ] M10 — `agent-skills:code-reviewer` pass + follow-up fix commits; final lint + three-target test run

## Surprises & Discoveries

(None yet)

## Decision Log

- **D1** (from design doc §6.1): bindings persist as virtual `keyCode` + `ModifierMask`, not `Character` + modifiers. Rationale lives in the design doc; the consequence for execution is that `ShortcutDisplay` (M4) must run `UCKeyTranslate` against the active keyboard layout for keycap rendering, against US-QWERTY for SwiftUI `KeyEquivalent` binding.
- **D2** (from design doc §6.2): shortcuts persist to a standalone `~/.config/touch-code/shortcuts.json` file, not into `Settings.json`. M3 mirrors `SettingsStore` boilerplate (atomic write, 500 ms debounce, broken-file backup) into a parallel `ShortcutsStore`.
- **D3** (from design doc §6.3): `CommandID` is a closed enum with `CaseIterable`. The numbered tab/sidebar cases (`switchToTab1..9`, `selectWorktreeAt1..9`) are spelled out individually so they appear as first-class JSON keys and participate in exhaustive switches.
- **D4** (per execution constraints from user, 2026-04-28): every milestone produces exactly one commit (or, where M2 splits, one per parallel sub-agent leaf). The commit only stages files that milestone touched — never `git add -A` / `git add -u`. Commit messages do **not** carry a `Co-Authored-By` trailer.
- **D5** (per execution constraints from user, 2026-04-28): M2's five pure-data leaves (override store, resolver, reset planner, three conflict detectors) parallelize via `Agent` sub-agents using `general-purpose` type after M1 lands. They share the base types from M1 but otherwise touch disjoint files; each sub-agent owns one or two new files plus its tests. Master agent commits each leaf as it completes. M4 (display) and M5 (env+modifier) similarly parallelize after M3 lands — they share zero files.
- **D6** (Project.swift handling): `TouchCodeCore/Shortcuts/` is already declared as a `buildableFolder` in `apps/mac/Project.swift:38`, so new files dropped there are picked up by `make mac-generate` automatically. New nested test folders (`TouchCodeCoreTests/Shortcuts`, `touch-code/Tests/Shortcuts`) require explicit `buildableFolders` entries — added in the same commit as the first test file under each path. New app-tier folders under `touch-code/App/Shortcuts/` are covered by the recursive `touch-code/App` parent entry; verified by analogy with `touch-code/App/Commands/` which is not separately listed and compiles fine.

## Outcomes & Retrospective

(To be filled at milestone completion)

## Context and Orientation

Related documents:

- Design doc (this plan's source of truth): `docs/design-docs/keyboard-shortcuts.md`
- Architecture doc: `docs/architecture.md`
- Existing settings ExecPlans for atomic-store boilerplate reference: `docs/exec-plans/0009-mw-t1-sidebar.md`, plus `docs/design-docs/settings-base.md`

Key source files (full repository-relative paths):

- `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Shortcuts/CommandPaletteShortcut.swift` — current `keyChar` / `displayString` constants for `⌘P`. **Deleted in M6** after consumers migrate to the registry.
- `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Settings/Settings.swift` — pattern reference for the v3-versioned `Codable` struct, `defaultURL()` helper, and migration shape. M1's `ShortcutSchema.swift` and M3's `ShortcutsStore.swift` mirror these patterns at v1.
- `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/Settings/SettingsStore.swift` — pattern reference for `@MainActor @Observable` file-owning store with `AtomicFileStore`, 500 ms debounce, broken-file backup. M3's `ShortcutsStore` is a parallel implementation.
- `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/AtomicFileStore.swift` (or wherever the helper lives — `Bash` audit at M3 entry) — reused as-is for the new shortcuts file write path.
- `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Commands/MainWindowCommands.swift` — defines thirteen window-scope bindings. **Rewritten in M6** to read every chord from the env-injected `ResolvedShortcutMap`.
- `apps/mac/touch-code/App/TouchCodeApp.swift` — app composition root and the `⌘,` settings binding (line 85). M6 instantiates `ShortcutsStore` here, injects `\.resolvedShortcuts` at the top of the view tree, and leaves the literal `⌘,` binding in place (registry tracks it as `.systemFixed` for display only).
- `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/HierarchySidebar/HierarchySidebarView.swift` — sidebar row hotkey block at lines 619–631 plus the `hotkeyModifiers` constant at line 614. **Rewritten in M7**.
- `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/Settings/SettingsSection.swift` — already enumerates `.shortcuts` (line 17). No edit needed; the section is already wired to the sidebar.
- `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/Settings/SettingsWindowView.swift` — line 83 currently routes `.shortcuts` to `ComingSoonPane(title: "Shortcuts")`. **One-line edit in M9** to point at the new `ShortcutsSettingsView`.
- `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/CommandPalette/CommandPaletteItems.swift` (lines 79–124) — currently builds `KeyEquivalentDescriptor` rows from inline literal arrays. **Rewritten in M6** to derive each hint from the resolved map.
- `apps/mac/touch-code/Runtime/Status/StatusMotivationalView.swift` — currently reads `CommandPaletteShortcut.displayString`. **Rewritten in M6** to derive the hint from the resolved map.
- `apps/mac/Project.swift` — Tuist project manifest; touched in M2 and M3 for new test `buildableFolders` entries (`TouchCodeCoreTests/Shortcuts`, `touch-code/Tests/Shortcuts`).

Terms of art:

- **Registry** — the schema-defaults table plus the override-store overlay, exposed at runtime as a `ResolvedShortcutMap` keyed by `CommandID`. The single source of truth for every chord display, every menu binding, and every conflict check.
- **Schema audit** — a unit test that iterates `CommandID.allCases`, asserts each has exactly one entry in `ShortcutSchema.app.entries`, and snapshot-checks each default `(keyCode, modifiers)` pair against a hardcoded golden table that mirrors today's literal call sites. Pinned during M1 and unchanged thereafter; the test breaks if M6/M7 silently drift a chord during the migration.
- **Cascade reset** — when resetting command A would re-collide with command B's user override, `ShortcutResetPlanner` returns a plan that also clears B. The settings UI surfaces the cascade in the confirmation dialog so the user understands what they are about to lose.
- **Disabled binding** — `ShortcutBinding.isEnabled == false`. Persists the keyCode/modifiers but does not bind. Distinct from "no override" (defaults active) and from "no chord" (`binding == nil`, not used in v1 since every default is non-nil).
- **`buildableFolders`** — Tuist's mechanism for listing directories whose Swift files compile into a target. The TouchCodeCore framework target lists `TouchCodeCore/Shortcuts` (recursive); test targets list each nested subfolder explicitly.
- **Schema audit golden table** — a single array literal in `ShortcutSchemaAuditTests` that maps each `CommandID` to its expected `(keyCode, ModifierMask)` pair. Lifted from a one-time read of the current `MainWindowCommands` / `HierarchySidebarView` source. Updating it requires test failure as a forcing-function for review.

## Plan of Work

The work runs as ten milestones, vertically sliced — each milestone is independently buildable, lints clean, and either preserves or extends user-visible behavior. Behavior change starts at M6; M1–M5 add types and infrastructure that no live code path consumes yet, so they cannot regress anything.

### Milestone 1: TouchCodeCore types and schema audit

This milestone introduces the typed registry as inert data: a closed `CommandID` enum, the immutable `ShortcutBinding` struct, the `ShortcutScope` enum, and the `ShortcutSchema.app` defaults table. Nothing imports any of it yet; the only test is the schema audit, which guards against future drift.

Work:

- Add `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Shortcuts/CommandID.swift` declaring the closed `String`-raw-valued enum exactly as listed in the design doc §3.3.1. Conformances: `String`, `CaseIterable`, `Hashable`, `Sendable`, `Codable`.
- Add `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Shortcuts/ShortcutBinding.swift` declaring `ShortcutBinding` (with `keyCode: UInt16`, `modifiers: ModifierMask`, `isEnabled: Bool`, all stored), `ModifierMask` (`OptionSet`-backed `UInt8` with `.command`, `.option`, `.control`, `.shift`), and the `Codable` shape that emits `modifiers` as a sorted string array (`["command", "shift"]`) for human-readable JSON.
- Add `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Shortcuts/ShortcutScope.swift` declaring the three-case enum.
- Add `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Shortcuts/ShortcutSchema.swift` declaring `ShortcutSchema`, `ShortcutSchema.Entry`, the `Category` enum (`general`, `tabs`, `sidebar`, `system`), and `ShortcutSchema.app: ShortcutSchema` with one entry per `CommandID` case. Defaults are read off the existing call sites: `⌘,` for `.openSettings`, `⌘P` for `.commandPaletteToggle`, `⌘E` for `.openInDefaultEditor`, `⌘⇧G` for `.toggleGitViewer`, `⌘F` for `.filterTags`, `⌘T` / `⌘W` / `⌘⇧[` / `⌘⇧]` for the tab quartet, `⌥⌘1..9` for `.switchToTab1..9`, `⌃⌘1..9` for `.selectWorktreeAt1..9`, plus `⌘Q` for `.quit` (`.systemFixed`, display-only — never bound by us, but listed for the Settings pane).
- Add `apps/mac/TouchCodeCoreTests/Shortcuts/ShortcutSchemaAuditTests.swift` with two tests:
  - `everyCommandIDHasExactlyOneSchemaEntry` — iterate `CommandID.allCases`, verify membership in `Set(ShortcutSchema.app.entries.map(\.id))` and absence of duplicates.
  - `defaultsMatchGoldenTable` — compare `ShortcutSchema.app.entries` against an inline golden `[CommandID: (UInt16, ModifierMask)]` literal that mirrors the current `MainWindowCommands` and `HierarchySidebarView` call sites. Use the `Carbon.HIToolbox` `kVK_*` constants for keyCodes (e.g. `kVK_ANSI_P`, `kVK_ANSI_G`, `kVK_ANSI_LeftBracket`).
- Add `TouchCodeCoreTests/Shortcuts` to `apps/mac/Project.swift` `buildableFolders` for the `TouchCodeCoreTests` target.
- `make mac-generate && make mac-build` and `make mac-check` from `apps/mac/`.

Acceptance: the project builds, `TouchCodeCoreTests` compiles, and the audit tests pass. No app-target code consumes any of the new types yet, so manual app behavior is unchanged. **Commit M1** stages only:

```
apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Shortcuts/CommandID.swift
apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Shortcuts/ShortcutBinding.swift
apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Shortcuts/ShortcutScope.swift
apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Shortcuts/ShortcutSchema.swift
apps/mac/TouchCodeCoreTests/Shortcuts/ShortcutSchemaAuditTests.swift
apps/mac/Project.swift
```

### Milestone 2: Override store, resolver, reset planner, and conflict detectors

This milestone adds the resolution logic that turns the schema and a user override store into a `ResolvedShortcutMap`, plus the three conflict detectors and the cascading-reset planner. Everything stays in TouchCodeCore (still SwiftUI-free, still AppKit-free for the most part — `SystemReservedDetector` reads `CFPreferences` directly via `Foundation`'s `UserDefaults(suiteName: "com.apple.symbolichotkeys")`, which is acceptable in TouchCodeCore).

Work proceeds as one sequential prefix (the override store + resolver, since the rest of the milestone's leaves depend on `ResolvedShortcutMap`) followed by four parallel leaves dispatched as `Agent` sub-agents:

**Sequential prefix (master agent):**

- Add `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Shortcuts/ShortcutOverrideStore.swift` declaring the `Codable` document type. JSON shape per design doc §3.3.5: top-level `version: Int` plus sparse `overrides: [CommandID: ShortcutBinding]`.
- Add `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Shortcuts/ShortcutResolver.swift` declaring `ResolvedShortcut`, `ResolvedShortcut.Source`, `ResolvedShortcutMap` typealias, and the pure `ShortcutResolver.resolve(schema:overrides:)` function.
- Add `apps/mac/TouchCodeCoreTests/Shortcuts/ShortcutOverrideStoreCodableTests.swift` exercising round-trip Codable with the documented JSON shape.
- Add `apps/mac/TouchCodeCoreTests/Shortcuts/ShortcutResolverTests.swift` with three cases: empty overrides ⇒ schema verbatim; one override ⇒ merged; one disabled override ⇒ resolved with `isEnabled = false` and `source = .userOverride`.
- **Commit M2.0** stages: `ShortcutOverrideStore.swift`, `ShortcutResolver.swift`, the two new test files.

**Parallel leaves (four `Agent` sub-agents, dispatched concurrently):**

The four leaves below share read-only access to the M2.0 types and write to disjoint files. Master dispatches them as four `Agent` calls in a single message, using `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`. Each agent's brief: read the design doc §3.4 / §3.4.1 plus the listed reference files, implement its own file plus tests, run `make mac-check` from `apps/mac/`, and report the diff.

- **Leaf A — `ShortcutResetPlanner`** (one agent): `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Shortcuts/ShortcutResetPlanner.swift` plus `apps/mac/TouchCodeCoreTests/Shortcuts/ShortcutResetPlannerTests.swift`. Tests must cover the swap-conflict case (A's default == B's user override; B's default == A's user override → reset of A cascades to reset B).
- **Leaf B — `SystemReservedDetector`** (one agent): `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Shortcuts/ConflictDetectors/SystemReservedDetector.swift` plus tests. Reads `com.apple.symbolichotkeys` via `UserDefaults(suiteName:)`. Parses `AppleSymbolicHotKeys` plist into a set of `(keyCode, ModifierMask)` triples for chords with `enabled == true`. Cached per-process; refresh hook for `UserDefaults.didChangeNotification`. Tests use a mock `UserDefaults` instance with a hand-crafted plist.
- **Leaf C — `AppKitReservedDetector`** (one agent): `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Shortcuts/ConflictDetectors/AppKitReservedDetector.swift` plus tests. Static hardcoded set: `⌘Q`, `⌘W`, `⌘H`, `⌘M`, `⌘,`, `⌘?`. Pure function `isReserved(keyCode:modifiers:) -> Bool`.
- **Leaf D — `InternalConflictDetector`** (one agent): `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Shortcuts/ConflictDetectors/InternalConflictDetector.swift` plus tests. Pure function `conflicts(in: ResolvedShortcutMap, candidate: ShortcutBinding, excluding: CommandID) -> CommandID?`. Returns the colliding command's ID or `nil`. Tests cover: same chord different scope (no conflict reported for `.systemFixed` rows), disabled override (no conflict), exact match (conflict).

Each leaf produces its own commit (**M2.A**, **M2.B**, **M2.C**, **M2.D**). Master enforces the no-`git-add-A` rule by reviewing each agent's reported file list and staging only those paths.

After all four leaves land:

- Master adds `apps/mac/Project.swift` entry for `TouchCodeCoreTests/Shortcuts/ConflictDetectors` if `buildableFolders` requires nested registration; otherwise merges the conflict-detector test files into the flat `TouchCodeCoreTests/Shortcuts` directory to keep the manifest minimal. Default plan: flat.
- `make mac-generate && make mac-build && make mac-check` from `apps/mac/`.

Acceptance: all five new types compile under TouchCodeCore; their unit tests pass; no app-target code consumes any of them yet; behavior unchanged.

### Milestone 3: ShortcutsStore (persistence)

This milestone introduces the live store that owns `~/.config/touch-code/shortcuts.json`, mirroring `SettingsStore` in shape and lifecycle.

Work:

- Add `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Shortcuts/ShortcutsStore.swift` declaring an `@MainActor @Observable final class ShortcutsStore` with: `private(set) var overrides: ShortcutOverrideStore`, computed `var resolved: ResolvedShortcutMap`, `update(_ id: CommandID, to binding: ShortcutBinding)`, `disable(_ id: CommandID)`, `clear(_ id: CommandID)`, `resetAll()`. Use `AtomicFileStore` (locate via `grep -rn "AtomicFileStore" apps/mac/`) and the `SettingsStore`-style 500 ms debounce + broken-file backup. File URL helper: `static func defaultURL(home:) -> URL` returning `~/.config/touch-code/shortcuts.json`.
- Add `apps/mac/touch-code/Tests/Shortcuts/ShortcutsStoreTests.swift` with three cases: round-trip write/read; debounce coalesces a burst of three `update` calls into one save (assert `AtomicFileStore` write count); broken-file backup on corrupted JSON.
- Add `touch-code/Tests/Shortcuts` to `apps/mac/Project.swift` `buildableFolders` for the `touch-codeTests` target.
- `make mac-generate && make mac-build && make mac-check`.

Acceptance: tests pass; app still launches with no behavior change because no caller constructs a `ShortcutsStore` yet. **Commit M3** stages: `ShortcutsStore.swift`, the test file, `Project.swift`.

### Milestone 4: ShortcutDisplay (UCKeyTranslate layer)

This milestone implements the layout-aware keycap renderer plus the SwiftUI `KeyEquivalent` conversion helper. It is independent of M3 and could be parallelized; in this plan it follows M3 sequentially because both are small and the cumulative diff stays clean.

Work:

- Add `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Shortcuts/ShortcutDisplay.swift` exposing:
  - `static func keycap(for keyCode: UInt16) -> String` — runs `UCKeyTranslate` against `TISCopyCurrentKeyboardLayoutInputSource()`. Special-cases arrows / function keys / Esc / Return / Tab / Space / numeric keypad to fixed glyphs. Fallback chain on `UCKeyTranslate` failure: active layout → US-QWERTY → `<0xNN>` hex stub.
  - `static func chord(for binding: ShortcutBinding) -> String` — concatenates modifier glyphs (⌃⌥⇧⌘ canonical order) plus `keycap(for:)`.
  - `static func keyEquivalent(for keyCode: UInt16) -> KeyEquivalent?` — maps to SwiftUI's `KeyEquivalent`. For arrow / function / Return / Tab / Space / Esc, returns the SwiftUI typed value. For character keys, runs `UCKeyTranslate` against US-QWERTY and wraps the resulting `Character`. Returns `nil` only for keyCodes that have no SwiftUI mapping.
  - `static var displayInvalidationToken: AnyPublisher<Void, Never>` — emits on `kTISNotifySelectedKeyboardInputSourceChanged` distributed notifications. Used by `ShortcutsStore` to bump an observable token that forces SwiftUI re-renders.
- Add `apps/mac/touch-code/Tests/Shortcuts/ShortcutDisplayTests.swift`. Tests programmatically install the U.S. ABC layout via `TISCreateInputSourceList` (or equivalent) for determinism, then assert that `keyCode = kVK_ANSI_G` renders `"G"`, that `kVK_ANSI_LeftBracket` renders `"["`, that `kVK_UpArrow` renders `"↑"`, that an invalid keyCode falls through to the hex stub.

Acceptance: tests pass; no behavior change. **Commit M4** stages: `ShortcutDisplay.swift`, the test file.

### Milestone 5: SwiftUI environment + view modifier

This milestone introduces the wiring that lets call sites read shortcuts from the registry. Like M4, independent of M3; sequenced after for diff hygiene.

Work:

- Add `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Shortcuts/ShortcutEnvironment.swift` declaring `private struct ResolvedShortcutsKey: EnvironmentKey { static let defaultValue: ResolvedShortcutMap = [:] }` and the `EnvironmentValues.resolvedShortcuts` accessor.
- Add `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Shortcuts/View+appKeyboardShortcut.swift` declaring two overloads:
  - `View.appKeyboardShortcut(_ id: CommandID, in map: ResolvedShortcutMap) -> some View` — explicit-map form for `Commands` scenes.
  - `View.appKeyboardShortcut(_ id: CommandID) -> some View` — env-driven form for ordinary view contexts; reads `@Environment(\.resolvedShortcuts)`.
  Both short-circuit (return `self` unchanged) when the resolved entry is missing, disabled, or its keyCode has no `KeyEquivalent`.
- Add `apps/mac/touch-code/Tests/Shortcuts/AppKeyboardShortcutTests.swift` with one snapshot-style test: a `@Test func appliedBindingMatchesRegistry` that constructs a tiny view tree, injects a known `ResolvedShortcutMap`, and asserts via Inspector or a behaviour proxy that the modifier produced the expected binding. If view-introspection is too heavy, instead unit-test the helper that lives behind the modifier (a non-view `static func resolve(_ id: CommandID, in map: ResolvedShortcutMap) -> (KeyEquivalent, EventModifiers)?`) and trust the modifier's three-line `@ViewBuilder` body.

Acceptance: tests pass. **Commit M5** stages: `ShortcutEnvironment.swift`, `View+appKeyboardShortcut.swift`, the test file.

### Milestone 6: Wire registry into the app — first behavior-touching milestone

This is the load-bearing migration. The thirteen `MainWindowCommands` literals plus the two `CommandPaletteShortcut` consumers all switch to reading from the registry. Defaults are unchanged, so the visible behavior is identical to today's hardcoded build.

Work (single sequential thread; the file count is high enough that splitting would risk audit-test churn):

- Edit `apps/mac/touch-code/App/TouchCodeApp.swift`:
  - Instantiate a single `ShortcutsStore` alongside the existing `SettingsStore` (look for the `appState` / `store` setup in the `TouchCodeApp` `init` or the `WindowGroup` body; mirror the `SettingsStore` pattern).
  - Inject `\.resolvedShortcuts` at the top of the view tree: `ContentView(store: …).environment(\.resolvedShortcuts, shortcutsStore.resolved)`.
  - Pass the same store into the `MainWindowCommands` constructor (it cannot read `@Environment` directly inside `Commands`).
- Edit `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Commands/MainWindowCommands.swift`:
  - Add a `let shortcuts: ResolvedShortcutMap` stored property; the `TouchCodeApp` body passes the store's `resolved` value.
  - Replace each of the thirteen `.keyboardShortcut("…", modifiers: …)` calls with `.appKeyboardShortcut(.commandID, in: shortcuts)`. The `ForEach(1...9)` block uses a small switch to pick the right `CommandID` per index.
  - Update the doc-comment block at the top: replace the inline chord listing with a pointer to `ShortcutSchema.app` and the registry doc.
- Edit `apps/mac/touch-code/Runtime/Status/StatusMotivationalView.swift`:
  - Read `@Environment(\.resolvedShortcuts)` and derive the palette hint via `ShortcutDisplay.chord(for: shortcuts[.commandPaletteToggle]?.binding ?? defaultBinding)`. Fallback: the original literal `"⌘P"` if the resolved map is empty (defensive — env should always be populated).
- Edit `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/CommandPalette/CommandPaletteItems.swift`:
  - The two literal `KeyEquivalentDescriptor(["⌘", "⇧", "G"])`-style call sites at lines 85, 98, 124 derive their hint from the resolved map. Pass the map in via the `build(for:)` arguments (the `CommandPaletteFeature.State` / call-site signature already takes a context object; extend it minimally).
- Delete `apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Shortcuts/CommandPaletteShortcut.swift`. Verify no lingering references via `grep -rn "CommandPaletteShortcut" apps/mac/`.
- `make mac-generate && make mac-build && make mac-check`. Run `xcodebuild test -scheme TouchCodeCoreTests` and the touch-code test scheme.
- Manual smoke: build, run, exercise each chord — `⌘P` toggles palette, `⌘E` opens editor, `⌘⇧G` toggles git viewer, `⌘F` focuses tag filter, `⌘T` / `⌘W` / `⌘⇧[` / `⌘⇧]` operate tabs, `⌥⌘1..9` switches tabs.

Acceptance: schema audit (M1 test) still passes — proves no chord drifted during the rewrite. All thirteen window chords behave identically to pre-M6. Palette hint and motivational hint render `⌘P`. **Commit M6** stages exactly:

```
apps/mac/touch-code/App/TouchCodeApp.swift
apps/mac/touch-code/App/Commands/MainWindowCommands.swift
apps/mac/touch-code/Runtime/Status/StatusMotivationalView.swift
apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/CommandPalette/CommandPaletteItems.swift
apps/mac/TouchCodeCore/Shortcuts/CommandPaletteShortcut.swift   (deletion)
```

### Milestone 7: Sidebar row hotkeys

Migrate the nine `⌃⌘1..9` invisible-Button hotkeys to read from the registry. Behavior preserved.

Work:

- Edit `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/HierarchySidebar/HierarchySidebarView.swift`:
  - Inject `@Environment(\.resolvedShortcuts) private var shortcuts` on the row view.
  - Inside the row's `if let hotkeyNumber` branch (lines 619–631), swap `.keyboardShortcut(KeyEquivalent(Character("\(n)")), modifiers: Self.hotkeyModifiers)` for `.appKeyboardShortcut(commandID(forSidebarRow: hotkeyNumber))` where the helper maps `1...9 → CommandID.selectWorktreeAt1...9`.
  - Delete `private static let hotkeyModifiers: EventModifiers = [.command, .control]` at line 614 — no longer referenced.
- Manual smoke: `⌃⌘1..9` still selects the matching worktree row; the keycap chip rendered next to the row title (lines 600–611) keeps showing `⌃⌘N` (it reads from `hotkeyNumber` directly, not from the modifier set, so no edit needed).

Acceptance: identical sidebar selection behavior; lint clean. **Commit M7** stages exactly: `HierarchySidebarView.swift`.

### Milestone 8: Hotkey recorder

Introduce the recorder UI used by M9's settings pane. Self-contained — nothing consumes it yet.

Work:

- Add `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Shortcuts/HotkeyRecorder/HotkeyRecorderNSView.swift`:
  - `final class HotkeyRecorderNSView: NSView, NSTextFieldDelegate-equivalent` (use raw `acceptsFirstResponder`, `becomeFirstResponder`, `resignFirstResponder`, and `keyDown(with:)` overrides).
  - On `becomeFirstResponder`, install a local-only `NSEvent.addLocalMonitorForEvents(matching: .keyDown)` returning `nil` to swallow events. Captures `(keyCode: UInt16, modifiers: NSEvent.ModifierFlags)`.
  - Validation pipeline: reject if `modifiers` lacks `⌘`/`⌥`/`⌃` (shows "Add at least one modifier" via callback). Reject if only modifier is `⇧`. Otherwise convert to `ModifierMask` and run conflict detectors via callbacks the host injects.
  - Emits via callback closures: `onCommit(ShortcutBinding)`, `onReject(reason: RejectionReason)`, `onCancel()`.
- Add `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Shortcuts/HotkeyRecorder/HotkeyRecorderView.swift`:
  - `struct HotkeyRecorderView: NSViewRepresentable` wrapping the AppKit view.
  - SwiftUI surface: `init(currentBinding: ShortcutBinding?, conflictDetector: (ShortcutBinding) -> ConflictResult, onCommit: (ShortcutBinding) -> Void)`.
  - Renders the current binding via `ShortcutDisplay.chord(for:)` when not recording; placeholder "Type a chord…" while recording. 200 ms shake animation on rejection.
- Add `apps/mac/touch-code/Tests/Shortcuts/HotkeyRecorderViewTests.swift` — assert the NSView's keyDown handler converts a known `(keyCode, modifierFlags)` pair into the expected `ShortcutBinding`, and that bare ⇧ + letter is rejected. This is doable without a running RunLoop by invoking the view's `keyDown(with:)` directly with a synthesized `NSEvent`.

Acceptance: tests pass; nothing consumes the recorder yet so app behavior unchanged. **Commit M8** stages: the two recorder files plus its test file.

### Milestone 9: Shortcuts settings pane

Replace the `ComingSoonPane` stub with the real Shortcuts pane. This is the user-visible payoff.

Work:

- Add `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/Settings/Panes/ShortcutsSettingsView.swift` rendering the layout sketched in design doc §3.9: search bar, restore-all button, four category sections (`general`, `tabs`, `sidebar`, `system`), one row per `ShortcutSchema.Entry`. Each row shows the title, the recorder cell, a per-row reset glyph (visible only when source is `.userOverride`), and a source pill (`Default` / `Custom` / `Disabled`). Context menu on the recorder offers "Disable shortcut".
  - The view reads `@Environment(\.resolvedShortcuts)` for display and writes via a `@Bindable var store: ShortcutsStore` for mutations.
  - Search filters by lowercased substring against the rendered title and `ShortcutDisplay.chord(...)`.
  - Cascade reset: when the per-row reset is tapped, call `ShortcutResetPlanner.plan(resetting:)` and present a `confirmationDialog` whose body lists every cascaded `CommandID` by title. On confirm, apply the plan via `store.applyResetPlan(...)`. (M9 adds the matching method to `ShortcutsStore` if absent — small extension.)
  - Internal-conflict popover during recorder commit: the recorder's `conflictDetector` callback wraps `InternalConflictDetector.conflicts(in:candidate:excluding:)`. When non-`nil`, the pane shows a confirmation popover ("Replace? Currently bound to *Toggle Git Viewer*.") with Replace / Cancel.
- Edit `apps/mac/touch-code/App/Features/Settings/SettingsWindowView.swift` line 83: change `case .shortcuts: ComingSoonPane(title: "Shortcuts")` to `case .shortcuts: ShortcutsSettingsView(store: shortcutsStore)`. Wire `shortcutsStore` through the same path `SettingsStore` already uses (likely an `@Bindable` from `TouchCodeApp` or via a child `Environment`).
- Add `apps/mac/touch-code/Tests/Shortcuts/ShortcutsSettingsViewTests.swift` with two snapshot tests via `SnapshotTesting` (already a test target dependency per `Project.swift:270`):
  - Default state — empty overrides, every row shows `Default`.
  - One overridden + one disabled — the appropriate pills, the reset glyph on the overridden row.
- `make mac-generate && make mac-build && make mac-check`.
- Manual smoke: open Settings → Shortcuts. Rebind `⌘T → ⌃T`, verify menu updates and `⌃T` opens a new tab and `⌘T` no longer does. Disable `⌘⇧G`, verify the menu item shows no chord and the chord no longer fires the action. Click reset on `⌘T`, verify it reverts. Click Restore All, verify all overrides clear. Switch input source (English ABC → Pinyin – Simplified) and verify keycaps re-render.

Acceptance: Settings pane is usable end-to-end; all three test schemes still pass. **Commit M9** stages: `ShortcutsSettingsView.swift`, `SettingsWindowView.swift`, the snapshot test file plus its `__Snapshots__` directory output, and any tiny `ShortcutsStore` API additions made in this milestone.

### Milestone 10: Code review and follow-up

Hand the branch off to `agent-skills:code-reviewer` for a five-axis review (correctness, readability, architecture, security, performance). Apply fixes per its findings.

Work:

- Run the code-reviewer agent with prompt anchored to the design doc and this ExecPlan as context. Provide the diff range `git log main..HEAD --oneline` produced by M1–M9.
- For each actionable finding, apply the fix in a focused commit. Trivial style nits roll up into one fixup commit; substantive fixes get their own.
- Re-run lint and three test schemes after each fixup.

Acceptance: reviewer's "blocking" findings are resolved; "non-blocking" findings are either resolved or recorded in this plan's Surprises & Discoveries with rationale. **Commit M10.x** for each fix; final `git log main..HEAD --oneline` reads as a clean linear history of M1 → M2.0 → M2.A..M2.D → M3..M9 → M10.x fixups.

## Concrete Steps

The standard cadence inside `apps/mac/`:

```
$ make mac-generate                # after Project.swift edits
$ make mac-build
$ make mac-check                   # swift-format + swiftlint
```

Test runs (issue from `apps/mac/`):

```
$ xcodebuild -workspace touch-code.xcworkspace -scheme TouchCodeCoreTests \
    -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' test | xcbeautify
$ xcodebuild -workspace touch-code.xcworkspace -scheme touch-code \
    -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' test | xcbeautify
$ xcodebuild -workspace touch-code.xcworkspace -scheme tcKitTests \
    -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' test | xcbeautify
```

Expected after a clean M1 run: `TouchCodeCoreTests` reports `2 tests, 0 failures` for the new `ShortcutSchemaAuditTests`. Adjust totals after each milestone.

Per-milestone commit pattern (issued from repo root):

```
$ git status -s                                   # confirm only intended files
$ git add <explicit paths from milestone>
$ git diff --cached --stat                        # confirm scope
$ git commit -m "<message>"                       # NO --amend, NO -A, NO co-author
```

Commit message convention (matches existing `git log main..HEAD`-equivalent):

- `feat(shortcuts): add CommandID + schema with audit test (M1)`
- `feat(shortcuts): add override store + resolver (M2.0)`
- `feat(shortcuts): add reset planner (M2.A)`
- `feat(shortcuts): add system reserved detector (M2.B)`
- `feat(shortcuts): add appkit reserved detector (M2.C)`
- `feat(shortcuts): add internal conflict detector (M2.D)`
- `feat(shortcuts): persist overrides to shortcuts.json (M3)`
- `feat(shortcuts): layout-aware display via UCKeyTranslate (M4)`
- `feat(shortcuts): SwiftUI environment + appKeyboardShortcut modifier (M5)`
- `refactor(shortcuts): main window commands read from registry (M6)`
- `refactor(shortcuts): sidebar row hotkeys read from registry (M7)`
- `feat(shortcuts): hotkey recorder NSViewRepresentable (M8)`
- `feat(shortcuts): settings shortcuts pane (M9)`
- `fix(shortcuts): <reviewer finding> (M10.x)`

## Validation and Acceptance

The system is complete when:

1. `make mac-build` and `make mac-check` succeed from a fresh `make mac-generate`.
2. All three test schemes pass: `TouchCodeCoreTests`, `touch-codeTests`, `tcKitTests`.
3. The schema audit test exercised in M1 still passes after M9 — proof that no chord silently drifted during the migration.
4. Manual end-to-end script (run after M9):
   - Build app, launch.
   - Press `⌘P` → palette opens. Press `Esc`. Press `⌘E` → editor opens (or noop if no worktree). Press `⌘⇧G` → git viewer toggles. Press `⌘F` → tag filter focuses. Press `⌘T` → new tab. Press `⌘W` → close tab. Press `⌥⌘3` → switch to tab 3. Press `⌃⌘2` → select sidebar worktree row 2. (All thirteen + nine bindings observed working.)
   - Open Settings → Shortcuts. Verify all rows render with correct chords. Search "git" → only matching rows visible. Click Toggle Git Viewer's chord cell, press `⌃⌥G`, click out → menu chord updates immediately, `⌃⌥G` now toggles git viewer, `⌘⇧G` no longer does.
   - Click the `⟲` next to Toggle Git Viewer → confirmation says "Reset to ⌘⇧G?" → confirm → original chord restored.
   - Right-click a chord cell → "Disable shortcut" → row pill flips to `Disabled`, menu item shows no chord, pressing the chord does nothing. Right-click again → "Enable" → chord restored.
   - Click Restore All → confirmation → every row reverts. `~/.config/touch-code/shortcuts.json` becomes `{"version":1,"overrides":{}}` (or non-existent).
   - Switch input source to a non-Latin layout (System Settings → Keyboard → Input Sources). Reopen the pane. Keycaps re-render in the active layout's glyphs.

## Idempotence and Recovery

- Each milestone's commit is independently revertible. M6's `CommandPaletteShortcut.swift` deletion is the only structural deletion; reverting M6 restores the file from git.
- `make mac-generate` is idempotent — re-running after no `Project.swift` change is a no-op (Tuist caches).
- The schema audit test is the safety net for M6/M7: if either milestone accidentally drifts a default, the test fails loudly. Rolling back is `git revert <SHA>` of the offending commit.
- `~/.config/touch-code/shortcuts.json` is created lazily on first user override. To reset state during development, delete the file; the store recreates an empty document on next save.
- If `make mac-generate` fails after a `Project.swift` edit (typically a missing nested `buildableFolder`), the fix is to add the path; no recovery beyond re-running `make mac-generate`.

## Artifacts and Notes

The Carbon `kVK_*` constants used in M1 live in `Carbon.HIToolbox.Events.h`. Representative values referenced by the schema:

```
kVK_ANSI_P            = 0x23
kVK_ANSI_G            = 0x05
kVK_ANSI_E            = 0x0E
kVK_ANSI_F            = 0x03
kVK_ANSI_T            = 0x11
kVK_ANSI_W            = 0x0D
kVK_ANSI_Q            = 0x0C
kVK_ANSI_LeftBracket  = 0x21
kVK_ANSI_RightBracket = 0x1E
kVK_ANSI_Comma        = 0x2B
kVK_ANSI_1 ... 9      = 0x12, 0x13, 0x14, 0x15, 0x17, 0x16, 0x1A, 0x1C, 0x19
```

(Note: `kVK_ANSI_5` and `kVK_ANSI_6` are 0x17 / 0x16 respectively — easy to swap. The audit test catches drift either way.)

Schema golden table (paste into `ShortcutSchemaAuditTests.swift`):

```swift
let golden: [CommandID: (UInt16, ModifierMask)] = [
  .openSettings: (UInt16(kVK_ANSI_Comma), [.command]),
  .quit: (UInt16(kVK_ANSI_Q), [.command]),
  .commandPaletteToggle: (UInt16(kVK_ANSI_P), [.command]),
  .openInDefaultEditor: (UInt16(kVK_ANSI_E), [.command]),
  .toggleGitViewer: (UInt16(kVK_ANSI_G), [.command, .shift]),
  .filterTags: (UInt16(kVK_ANSI_F), [.command]),
  .newTab: (UInt16(kVK_ANSI_T), [.command]),
  .closeTab: (UInt16(kVK_ANSI_W), [.command]),
  .previousTab: (UInt16(kVK_ANSI_LeftBracket), [.command, .shift]),
  .nextTab: (UInt16(kVK_ANSI_RightBracket), [.command, .shift]),
  .switchToTab1: (UInt16(kVK_ANSI_1), [.command, .option]),
  // … through switchToTab9
  .selectWorktreeAt1: (UInt16(kVK_ANSI_1), [.command, .control]),
  // … through selectWorktreeAt9
]
```
