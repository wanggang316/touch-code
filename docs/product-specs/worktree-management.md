# Product Spec: Worktree Management

**Status:** Draft
**Author:** Gump (with Claude)
**Date:** 2026-04-21

## Summary

A **Worktree** is a `git worktree` of a Project — a concrete branch checkout on disk with its own directory and its own Tab/Pane layout. touch-code is built around the workflow of running multiple features in parallel, one Worktree per feature, each with its own terminal and agent. This spec covers the full user-facing Worktree lifecycle: creating a Worktree (branch name + base ref + optional fetch), listing pre-existing ones, switching between them, archiving (soft-hide, reversible), removing (physical delete with safety checks), and pruning stale entries. Worktree operations run through the bundled `git-wt` helper (the same one supacode uses), which wraps `git worktree` with better defaults and streaming output.

## Background: why `git-wt`

Rather than shelling out to `git worktree` directly, touch-code bundles the open-source [`git-wt`](https://github.com/khoi/git-wt) helper as a submodule (same as supacode). It covers the common create/list/remove surface with:

- JSON-formatted listing (cleaner than parsing porcelain output),
- sensible path defaults,
- copy-ignored / copy-untracked flags for seeding a new worktree from the current checkout,
- streaming output so long-running operations (`--copy-ignored` on big repos) can drive a progress UI.

This spec describes the user-facing behavior; the `git-wt` dependency is noted here for completeness but is a design-level detail.

## User Stories

- As a developer starting a new feature, I want to create a Worktree by specifying a branch name and base ref so I can spin up an isolated checkout without typing the full `git worktree add` incantation.
- As a user with uncommitted tooling (`.env`, `node_modules`) in the current checkout, I want an option to copy ignored and/or untracked files into the new Worktree so it's immediately runnable.
- As a user returning to a Project, I want existing worktrees — including those I created on the CLI outside touch-code — to show up automatically in the sidebar.
- As a user switching between features, I want clicking a Worktree in the sidebar to instantly activate its tabs, panes, and terminal state.
- As a user finishing a feature, I want to **archive** a Worktree to hide it from the main list without deleting files, so I can come back if I need to re-run or re-reference it.
- As a user cleaning up, I want to **remove** a Worktree — physically delete the directory and deregister the branch from git — with a safety check for uncommitted changes and a confirmation dialog.
- As a user whose worktrees got deleted outside touch-code, I want a **prune** action that clears stale git references and orphaned sidebar rows.
- As a user who made a mistake, I want to **unarchive** a previously archived Worktree and restore it to the main list.
- As a user experimenting, I want to see the current branch, local change count, and last-modified time on each Worktree row so I can decide what to work on next.

## Requirements

### Must Have

#### Create

- [ ] **Create Worktree sheet** triggered from the sidebar Project row's `[+]` button. The sheet prompts for:
  - **Branch name** (required). Must pass `git check-ref-format --branch` (live validation). Must not collide with an existing local branch in this Project; duplicate-branch is a blocking error.
  - **Base ref** (required; pre-populated with an automatic choice — typically the Project's default remote branch, e.g. `origin/main`). Dropdown lists local and remote refs.
  - **Fetch origin before creating** (optional toggle, default off). When on, run `git fetch origin` before creating.
  - **Copy ignored files** (optional toggle, default off). Passes `--copy-ignored` to `git-wt`.
  - **Copy untracked files** (optional toggle, default off). Passes `--copy-untracked` to `git-wt`.
- [ ] **Streaming progress.** When `copyIgnored` or `copyUntracked` is enabled, the sheet shows live output lines from `git-wt` so large copies don't look frozen.
- [ ] **Worktree path derivation.** The on-disk path is computed as `<Project.worktreesDirectory>/<sanitized-branch-name>`, where `Project.worktreesDirectory` defaults to `~/.touch-code/repos/<project-name>/` (per [Project Management spec](project-management.md)). Branch-name sanitization: replace `/` with `-` and strip characters invalid on macOS filesystems.
- [ ] **Post-create selection.** On success, the new Worktree is added to the sidebar, selected, and a single Tab with a single Pane opens in its directory.
- [ ] **Create failure handling.** On failure, the sheet stays open with a human-readable error (branch exists / ref not found / filesystem error / `git fetch` failed); no partial state is left in `catalog.json`.

#### List / discover

- [ ] **Discover existing worktrees.** On Project add and on reconcile (app launch + window focus), query `git-wt ls --json` and merge results into the sidebar. Worktrees created on the CLI outside touch-code appear without user action.
- [ ] **Main-checkout present.** The Project's main checkout is always listed as the first Worktree row. It is the only Worktree that cannot be removed or archived from the app.
- [ ] **Per-Worktree metadata.** Each row surfaces:
  - branch name (or detached HEAD indicator),
  - relative path from the Project's git root (for disambiguation when two worktrees share a branch label),
  - an unread-notification dot (consuming existing `InboxClient` data),
  - an active-Worktree marker (the current selection in this Project).
- [ ] **Ordering.** Worktrees are sorted by creation time (newest first), with the main checkout pinned at the top regardless of age.

#### Switch

- [ ] **One-click activation.** Clicking a Worktree row selects it, restores its Tabs/Panes, and updates the header's branch label and git-viewer state.
- [ ] **Switch is instant.** No progress UI; state for the target Worktree is already in memory. (Inherits from T1/T3 behavior — this spec just affirms it applies to newly-created Worktrees too.)

#### Archive (soft hide, reversible)

- [ ] **Archive Worktree** action on the row's context menu. Archiving:
  - hides the Worktree from the Project's main list in the sidebar,
  - closes any open Tabs/Panes of that Worktree,
  - does **not** touch files on disk,
  - does **not** deregister the branch from git,
  - is reversible via Unarchive.
- [ ] **Archived-Worktrees surface.** A secondary surface (sheet or dedicated section at the bottom of the Project) lists the Project's archived Worktrees, with Unarchive and Remove actions per row.
- [ ] **Unarchive** returns the Worktree to the main list at its original creation-time sort position; no tabs/panes are auto-reopened (user selects to re-activate).
- [ ] **Archive confirmation.** First-time archive in a session shows a confirmation explaining the soft-hide semantics ("Files and branch are kept. Find it later under 'Archived Worktrees'."). Subsequent archives skip the confirmation for the rest of the session.

#### Remove (hard delete)

- [ ] **Remove Worktree** action on the row's context menu and on each Archived-Worktrees row. Two modes:
  - **Safe remove** — runs `git worktree remove` (via `git-wt`) without `--force`. Fails if the worktree has uncommitted changes or is locked; the error is surfaced with a one-click "Force Remove" follow-up.
  - **Force remove** — runs `git worktree remove --force`. Always shown via a confirmation dialog that explicitly calls out "uncommitted changes will be discarded" and "this cannot be undone".
- [ ] **Remove effects.** On success:
  - the worktree directory is deleted from disk,
  - the worktree is deregistered from git (`.git/worktrees/<name>` removed by git),
  - the row disappears from the sidebar and from the archived list (if applicable),
  - any open Tabs/Panes of that Worktree are closed.
- [ ] **Remove failure handling.** On failure, leave the Worktree in place with the git error message in a banner; never leave catalog and disk out of sync.
- [ ] **Main checkout cannot be removed** from within touch-code; the context-menu entry is hidden for that row.

#### Prune

- [ ] **Prune stale** action, available on each Project's `⋯` menu. Runs `git worktree prune` and then re-queries `git-wt ls --json`; rows whose directories no longer exist are removed from the sidebar. A summary toast ("Pruned 2 stale worktrees") confirms the result.

#### Safety and reconciliation

- [ ] **Uncommitted-changes check before remove.** Safe remove surfaces the specific reason ("3 uncommitted files in <path>") instead of a generic error, so users can make an informed choice before force-removing.
- [ ] **External deletion resilience.** If a Worktree's directory is deleted outside touch-code, the reconcile on window focus marks the row as stale and offers a one-click "Prune" — never a crash, never a silent state mismatch.

### Nice to Have

- [ ] **Rename branch** inside an existing Worktree (wrapper around `git branch -m`), with live name validation.
- [ ] **Line-change badge** — small `+123 -45` indicator per Worktree row (supacode has this).
- [ ] **Git fetch action** per Worktree — context menu "Fetch origin" without going through the Create flow.
- [ ] **Copy path** action on the Worktree row.
- [ ] **Reveal in Finder** on the Worktree row.
- [ ] **Branch-name autocomplete** in the Create sheet (tab-completion against local branches you might want to re-use).
- [ ] **Worktree templates / hooks** — run a user-defined script after a new Worktree is created (e.g. `pnpm install`). Beyond v1.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Create

- **Given** a Project with `worktreesDirectory` at the default `~/.touch-code/repos/<project-name>/`, **when** the user creates a Worktree named `feature/login` from base `origin/main`, **then** a new directory appears at `~/.touch-code/repos/<project-name>/feature-login/`, a Worktree row is added to the sidebar, and a terminal opens in that directory.
- **Given** the user types a branch name that already exists locally, **when** they attempt to create, **then** the Create button is disabled and an inline error reads "Branch 'x' already exists".
- **Given** the user types an invalid branch name (e.g. with spaces), **when** the live validator runs, **then** the error "Branch name is invalid" appears and the Create button is disabled.
- **Given** the user enables "Copy ignored" on a repo with a 500 MB `node_modules`, **when** creation runs, **then** the sheet streams progress lines and the Create button re-enables only on completion; the resulting Worktree has `node_modules/` in place.
- **Given** the user enables "Fetch origin" and the network is down, **when** they attempt to create, **then** the fetch error is surfaced clearly and no Worktree is created.

### List / switch

- **Given** a user manually ran `git worktree add` outside touch-code, **when** they focus the touch-code window, **then** the new Worktree appears in the sidebar within the reconcile cycle.
- **Given** two Worktrees on the same branch at different paths, **when** they are listed, **then** each row shows the relative path so the user can disambiguate.
- **Given** the user clicks an inactive Worktree row, **when** it becomes active, **then** the header branch label updates and the Worktree's saved Tabs/Panes restore.

### Archive

- **Given** a Worktree is archived, **when** the user looks in the main Project list, **then** it is no longer visible; **and when** they open "Archived Worktrees", **then** it is present.
- **Given** an archived Worktree, **when** the user chooses Unarchive, **then** it returns to the main list in its original relative order.
- **Given** an archived Worktree, **when** the user chooses Remove from the archived list, **then** the same remove flow applies (safe / force) and on success it disappears from both lists and the disk directory is deleted.

### Remove

- **Given** a Worktree with 3 modified files, **when** the user chooses Safe Remove, **then** the operation fails, the error message names the uncommitted files, and a "Force Remove" button appears in the error dialog.
- **Given** the user confirms Force Remove, **when** it completes, **then** the worktree directory is gone, the row disappears, any terminal tabs in it are closed, and `git worktree list` no longer references it.
- **Given** the main checkout row, **when** the user opens the context menu, **then** no Remove or Archive action is present.

### Prune

- **Given** a Worktree whose directory was deleted from disk outside touch-code, **when** the user triggers Prune on the Project, **then** the stale row disappears and a toast reports "Pruned 1 stale worktree".

## Scope

### In Scope

- Create with branch name + base ref + optional fetch + optional copy-ignored/untracked.
- Auto-discover worktrees created outside touch-code.
- Switch Worktree with full state restoration.
- Archive / unarchive (soft, reversible).
- Safe remove + force remove with explicit confirmation.
- Prune stale references.
- Per-row metadata: branch, relative path, unread dot, active indicator.

### Out of Scope (v1)

- **Worktree from a detached commit without a branch** — v1 always creates a named branch.
- **Rebase / merge / pull / push / commit UI** — terminal-first; use `git`, `lazygit`, etc.
- **Multi-worktree bulk operations** (e.g. "archive all merged worktrees").
- **Conflict-resolution UI.**
- **Archive script** (supacode runs a user-configured shell script on archive). v1 keeps archive as pure metadata; scripting can come back later as a C3 hook subscription.
- **Moving a Worktree between Projects.**
- **Changing a Worktree's on-disk path** after creation (users can force-remove and recreate).

### Future Consideration

- Archive hook / script, wired through C3.
- Inline rebase/merge helpers.
- Branch rename in-place.
- Auto-archive prompt when a PR merges (depends on GitHub integration).

## Design

Product-level only; technical shape of the Create sheet, reconcile scheduler, and error-surfacing UI goes into follow-up design docs.

References for the follow-up design:

- **supacode** — `GitClient` (`/Users/wanggang/dev/opensource/supacode/supacode/Clients/Git/GitClient.swift`) is the canonical shape for a `git-wt`-backed client, including `createWorktreeStream` for streaming progress and `worktrees(for:)` for listing. The `WorktreeCreationPromptFeature` reducer mirrors the sheet's validation flow almost one-to-one. supacode's archive feature in `RepositoriesFeature` (`archiveWorktreeConfirmed`, `unarchiveWorktree`, `ArchivedWorktreesDetailView`) is the archive UX we're borrowing.
- **`git-wt` tool** — <https://github.com/khoi/git-wt>. Bundle as a submodule under `apps/mac/ThirdParty/git-wt/` (mirroring supacode's `Resources/git-wt`), invoked with `Bundle.main.url(forResource:)`.
- **Existing code** — `HierarchyClient.createWorktree` and `HierarchyClient.removeWorktree` are data-only right now; they will be extended (or replaced) to run the actual git operations via a new `GitWorktreeClient`. `TouchCodeCore/Worktree.swift` will need a new `archived: Bool` field (default false; Codable `decodeIfPresent ?? false` to keep existing catalogs compatible).

## Open Questions

1. **`archived` persistence** — store `archived: Bool` on each `Worktree` (in-place) vs. a separate `archivedWorktrees` array per Project. *Leaning:* in-place flag with `decodeIfPresent` default; simpler, matches existing T0 patterns.
2. **Create-sheet base-ref default** — always the Project's default remote branch, or the currently-selected Worktree's branch? *Leaning:* default remote branch (matches supacode's `automaticWorktreeBaseRef`); predictable regardless of selection.
3. **Remove while terminals are running** — hard-kill attached processes before deleting the directory, or block with an error until terminals are closed? *Leaning:* hard-kill with explicit confirmation copy ("this will terminate N running processes in this Worktree"); otherwise force-remove has a frustrating trap.
4. **Where does `worktreesDirectory` live for edit** — inline in the Create sheet as an "advanced" disclosure, or only in the Project options sheet? *Leaning:* Project options only; per-create override would let users scatter worktrees and undermine the predictable default.
5. **Branch sanitization collision** — if two branches sanitize to the same directory name (e.g. `feature/a` and `feature-a` both become `feature-a`), reject at create time or append a suffix? *Leaning:* reject with a clear error; silent suffixing is confusing.
6. **Archive-script equivalent** — keep deferred to a future C3 hook (our current leaning) vs. v1-minimal "run a user-defined script on archive"? *Leaning:* defer; v1 ships pure-metadata archive.
