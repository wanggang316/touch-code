/// Entry point for loading `settings.json`: tries v2 first, falls back to v1 with a

/// The migration algorithm is documented in docs/design-docs/settings-base.md §Data Storage.
///
/// ## Atomicity invariant (PR #22 review B1/B2)
///
/// Data safety on the migration path is critical: a crash or partial failure must never
/// destroy the user's historical settings without producing a recoverable backup. The legacy
/// migration branch uses the sequence below, executed inside `load` so the caller can treat
/// `.migratedFromV1` as "both files durably on disk, caller need not write anything":
///
/// 1. Encode the migrated v2 tree and write it through `AtomicFileStore.write` to a
///    sibling temp URL (`<settings>.new-<uuid>`) — fsync inside AtomicFileStore means
///    the temp is durable before the next step runs.
/// 2. `rename(2)` the original v1 file to `settings.json.v1-<yyyyMMdd-HHmmss>`. After this
///    returns the backup has committed; the original path is empty.
/// 3. `rename(2)` the temp into the original path. The v2 file is durable at the
///    canonical URL, the backup at `.v1-<ts>`.
///
/// Failure handling per step:
/// - Step 1 fails → no changes on disk; `.migrationBackupFailed` returned.
/// - Step 2 fails → delete the temp, original still canonical; `.migrationBackupFailed`.
/// - Step 3 fails → attempt to restore the original by renaming the backup back; delete
///   the temp; `.migrationBackupFailed`.
///
/// The brief interval between step 2 and step 3 is the only window where the canonical
/// path is missing. A crash there leaves the durable backup — the next launch sees a
/// fresh file and the user can recover from `.v1-<ts>` manually.
