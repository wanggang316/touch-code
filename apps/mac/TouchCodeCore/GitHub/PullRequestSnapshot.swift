/// A compact view of one GitHub pull request tied to a Worktree. Decoded from
/// `gh pr view --json ...` output (v1 path) or from a batched `gh api graphql` response
/// (v2 path — see docs/design-docs/github-integration-batched.md) by the app-tier parsers.
/// The DTO itself uses GitHub's string enum values verbatim so the wire JSON decodes
/// directly.
///
/// Lives in `TouchCodeCore` rather than the app-tier `touch-code/GitHub/` so a future
/// `tc` IPC surface (`github.*` methods, deferred to v2) can ship the same value type
/// without a refactor. See `docs/exec-plans/0012-github-integration.md` DEC-7.
///
/// **v2 additions (0013 M2).** Four fields let the batched fetch path deliver everything
/// the sidebar badge + popover + merge affordances need in a single GraphQL roundtrip,
/// eliminating the separate `gh pr checks` subprocess. Each is `decodeIfPresent`-tolerant
/// so v1 decoders that do not populate them continue to round-trip unchanged:
///
///   - `checkRollup` — aggregated check list, replacing the separate `state.checks[prNumber]`
///     cache. Empty when no checks exist.
///   - `mergeStateStatus` — strictly more informative than `mergeable`. `.blocked` /
///     `.behind` / `.dirty` let the popover explain why merge is disabled.
///   - `reviewDecision` — nil if no reviewers required, else the final decision.
///   - `headRepositoryOwner` — source-side repository's owner login. Used by the batched
///     fetcher's fork-PR filter: a PR whose head repo owner ≠ our project's remote owner
///     is almost certainly a fork PR that happened to match our branch name, and the
///     fetcher skips it if an upstream alternative exists.
