/// Regression tests for the T3 main-window shortcuts
/// (`MainWindowCommands` + `RootFeature` wiring).
///
/// `Commands` structs are hard to exercise end-to-end from a unit test —
/// SwiftUI owns their body evaluation — so these tests split the contract
/// into two layers:
///
/// 1. **Structural** — `MainWindowCommands` must hold only the root store.
///    Any `@Dependency(...)` fields re-introduce the PR-#13 ⌘E crash: the
///    `Commands` struct resolves against `liveValue`, whose
///    `HierarchyClient.snapshot` is a `fatalError` stub.
///
/// 2. **Behavioural** — each shortcut's `store.send(...)` target lands in a
///    reducer branch with the expected effect. These mirror the shortcut-to-
///    action contract so a rename or action-semantics change is caught here
///    rather than in live-smoke-test territory.

  /// `liveValue` inside a SwiftUI `Commands` struct (TCA's `withDependencies` injection
  /// does not scope here), so any client whose `liveValue` has a `fatalError` stub crashes
  /// on first button tap. The allowed fields are inert: a closure to the root store, a
  /// resolved-shortcut snapshot, and the focus observer used to gate the destructive
  /// worktree chords. None of them carry a fatalError client.
