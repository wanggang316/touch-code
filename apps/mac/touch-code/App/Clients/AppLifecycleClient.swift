/// future quit-confirmation presenter interpose on `requestQuit` without
/// the hard `terminate` callers (e.g. an IPC `system.shutdown` handler)
/// accidentally going through that flow.
///
/// `NSApp.terminate(_:)` routes through `NSApplicationDelegate`'s
/// `applicationShouldTerminate(_:)`; `AppDelegate` in `TouchCodeApp.swift`
/// does not override that, so both closures terminate immediately. The
/// two-closure shape is forward-compatible with a future override that
/// distinguishes user-initiated from caller-initiated quits.
