/// on github.com; dwelling the cursor over the badge for 150 ms opens the rich
/// `PullRequestPopover` in place. The popover stays visible while the cursor is over
/// either the badge or the popover content — a 150 ms grace period covers the hand-off
/// between them so the popover does not flash away when the cursor transitions.
///
/// Per-row view so each instance carries its own `@State` (hover flags + debounce Task).
/// The parent `HierarchySidebarView` supplies the popover content as a `@ViewBuilder`
/// closure so the rich action surface keeps its dependency on `SettingsStore` without
/// this view needing to know.
