/// Observable that surfaces whether the `.command` modifier is currently held. Used by the
/// sidebar / tab bar / status bar to toggle hotkey hints (`⌃N`, `⌘N`, etc.) so users
/// discover the bindings without cluttering chrome in the default state.
///
/// Installs an `NSEvent` local monitor for `.flagsChanged` at init. The monitor fires on
/// the main thread, so `isCommandHeld` is mutated on the same thread SwiftUI reads from.
///
/// **Press-debounce.** Hints widen the chrome of every button they decorate (chord text
/// laid out inline with the label), so toggling them on every transient ⌘ tap — quick
/// chord triggers, finger glances, modifier-only chord prefixes — produces a lot of
/// distracting layout churn. We delay flipping `isCommandHeld → true` by
/// `pressActivationDelay` (default 280 ms): only sustained holds light up the hints. The
/// delay is one-way; releases flip back to `false` immediately so a chord that fires and
/// briefly grabs focus doesn't leave hints lingering after the user has let go.
///
/// **Active-state coupling.** When a chord like ⌘O fires a menu action that opens an
/// external editor, the OS hands focus to that editor. Any `flagsChanged` event that fires
/// for the ⌘ release while another app is frontmost is delivered to *that* app, not ours,
/// so the local monitor never sees it and `isCommandHeld` would stay stuck at `true` even
/// after the user has long since let the modifier go. We additionally listen for
/// `NSApplication.didResignActive` and clear the flag whenever touch-code goes to the
/// background — `flagsChanged` resumes delivering once the user re-presses ⌘ inside our
/// window, restoring the hint live.
///
/// The monitor + observer tokens live in a private `@unchecked Sendable` box so the
/// observer's nonisolated `deinit` can tear them down without tripping Swift 6 strict
/// concurrency.
