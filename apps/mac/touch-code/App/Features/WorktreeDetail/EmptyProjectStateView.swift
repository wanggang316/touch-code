/// Detail-pane placeholder shown when no Worktree is selected — typically
/// on first launch before any Project has been added, or after the catalog
/// pruned every existing Project.
///
/// HAN-65: deliberately blank. The sidebar's empty-state view owns the
/// "Open Project" call-to-action and the shortcut hint, so the detail
/// pane only needs to surface the window's background colour. Suppressing
/// the title + toolbar chrome in `WorktreeDetailView`'s placeholder branch
/// removes the lingering "touch-code" window title and the title-bar
/// divider; this view fills what's left.
///
/// Parameter is kept on the type so call sites that already thread a
/// sidebar-add hook in don't need to change — it is currently unused,
/// but the empty-state surface might gain a button again later.
