/// Reducer backing the Worktree Status Bar's center slot. Owns a single
/// transient `toast` value and its auto-clear lifecycle.
///
/// PR and motivational forms are view-level projections of other state
/// (`GitHubFeature.snapshots`, time of day) — not managed here. This reducer
/// only decides which toast (if any) is active and when it expires.
///
/// Auto-clear windows:
///   * `.success`    — 3 s
///   * `.warning`    — 8 s
///   * `.inProgress` — never auto-clears; emitter must push a terminal state.
///
/// Race-safe against rapid pushes: every push bumps `sequence` and the
/// scheduled `.cleared(sequence:)` fires a no-op if its captured sequence no
/// longer matches current state. That lets `.cancellable(cancelInFlight:)`
/// co-exist with a suspended `clock.sleep` that may still dispatch past its
/// cancellation point.
