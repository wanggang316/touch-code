/// (deterministic string output for given branches) and the chunking policy can be tuned
/// without touching the subprocess-runner code.
///
/// The query uses **GraphQL aliases** to fetch multiple branches' PR data in one request:
///
///     repository(owner, name) {
///       branch0: pullRequests(first: 5, headRefName: "<b0>", ...) { ... }

/// `[alias: originalBranch]` map so the decoder can pair results back to branch names —
/// the alias itself is a monotonic `branch<N>` label (not the branch name itself) so we
/// sidestep GraphQL's alias-name grammar (`/[_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*/`) which user branch
/// names like `feat/test-005` do not satisfy.
///
/// Branch names carry untrusted user data: they flow into the query body as GraphQL
/// string literals. The validator rejects any branch containing newlines or null bytes
/// (the only characters that cannot be made safe by escaping); every other character is
/// escaped into a double-quoted string per GraphQL's string lexical rules.
