/// Cached per-Worktree "is working tree dirty?" observer. The sidebar reads `isDirty`
/// keyed by `WorktreeID` to render a small pending-work dot next to the row.
///
/// - Fetches run lazily: the sidebar row's `.task(id:)` calls `refresh(worktreeID:path:)`
///   on appearance, branch change, or path change. A 30 s freshness window collapses
///   redundant re-fetches from hover churn / list re-renders.
/// - Failures are silent: a missing `.git` dir or a git-index lock returns the last
///   cached value (if any) and leaves `isDirty[id]` unchanged. The sidebar has no good
///   surface for per-row git errors, and a stale dot is less harmful than a wrong one.
/// - Lives in `Runtime/` next to `HierarchyManager` — same pattern: a
///   small observable service injected via `@Environment`, not TCA reducer state.
