# check-rename-residue.sh — guard against the Project Settings rename regressing.
#
# The Settings subtree refactor replaced specific `Repository*` identifiers with
# `Project*`. A rebase or sloppy find-and-replace can re-introduce the old names;
# this script catches those regressions by scanning for a concrete deny-list of
# symbols that must never reappear. Generic "Repository" / "repositories" tokens
# are **not** gated — they remain legitimately in:
#   - migration code describing the v2 → v3 move (`LegacyV2Settings`, decoder
#     comments referencing the old JSON key, ProjectSettings docstrings that
#     explain the rename)
#   - GitHub wire types (`headRepositoryOwner`, `repository { … }` query subsets)
#   - git-repository concept references in GitViewer / sidebar
#
# Usage: `./scripts/check-rename-residue.sh` (no args; defaults to `apps/mac/`).
#
# Exit 0 when the tree is clean. Exit 1 and print offending lines otherwise.
